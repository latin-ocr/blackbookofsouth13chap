tenement 011 the south and William Dert’s messuage on the
north, So that neither we, the aforesaid Laurence and Agnes
my wife, nor our heirs, nor any one else in our name can hence-
forth exact or 5611 any right or claim to the said tenement and
its appurtenances‚ in any manner, but we are totally excluded
from thence for ever by these presents. And we, the aforesaid
Laurence and Agnes my wife, and our heirs, will warrant for ever
the aforesaid tenement with its appurtenances to the aforesaid
William and william, their heirs and assigns against all men.
In witness whereof we place our seals to the present writing

have caused the seal of the mayoralty of Southampton to'be
affixed: these being witnesses, John Pulmond, mayor, John
Flete5 bailiff, Richard Bradway‚ steward of Southampton‚

Skarlett, and many others. Dated at Southampton‚ the four-
teenth of July, in the sixteenth year of the reign of Richard
the Second after the Conquest of England. And this writing
of release having been read and heard, the same Agnes was
examined and sworn by herself according to the custom of
the town and declared this to be her own deed, and publicly
owned that she had done it without coercion from her husband
aforesaid. And so she asked this be enrolled to the exclusion
of her right and that of her heirs in the tenement aforesaid,
according to the form of the writing aforesaid for ever, accord-
ing to the custom of the town. And this is granted by the
court and enrolled to the exclusion of her right and that of
her heirs for ever according to custom.
