PoslrroN OF WOMEN.

Other incidental notices in the Black Book and elsewhere
contribute to form the same impression 01 1110 strength and
importance of the local law in Southampton‚ as in other towns.
The position of women in the town—already touched upon—
furnishes an example of this.

In almost every town at this period and earlier, there were
special rules concerning the rights and powers 01 women-—
especially married women. No ordinances of the sort have yet
been published among the Southampton records3 but the deeds
in the Black Book suggest that the local customs were on the
whole favourable to women, and that these customs were
sustained by the local courts.

These customs seem to have favoured the economic prosperity
01 women, which is the more noteworthy since Southampton’s
chief economic interest, as has been said, was trade; and on the
whole women have perhaps taken less share in trade than in
industry. In this case the Port Books and Customs Accounts
give, every now and then, the name 01 3 woman who shared in
the lading 01 3 merchant vessel, but these notices are very few.
11 women did not trade, however, they seem to have owned land
and managed real property. The majority of conveyances in
the Black Book were made by husbands and wives jointly‚ to
husbands and wives jointly. Not only is the separate acceptance
by the wife almost invariably given, but besides this, the wife
joined in making the grant. In only one case is the wife's concern
in the matter said to rest on her right to dower. In this case the
husband made the grant alone. In certain cases land thus trans-
ferred by both husband and wife is said to have been recently
bought by the sellers, in which case the wife would very
generally be considered to have an interest in it. In others, it
belonged to the wife by inheritance. Generally speaking, how-
ever, no particulars are given of the method by which the
grantors became possessed 01 1110 1311(1; and the impression left
by a perusal 01 111050 documents is that in Southampton tene-
ments were normally regarded 35 1110 joint property 01 1110
husband and wife. The wife, however, could and did own
separate property. There is, at least, one case in which a wife
disposed 01 and received land without the concurrence 01 1101
husband (Fols. XVII B and XVIII). Moreover, a wife—as
well as widow——could and did will both lands and tenements,
