Lancaster in Southampton and the adjacent counties.l possibly,

while the majority of the wealthier burghers, like Fetplace,
Holmhegge and Gryme, may have supported the Yorkists, John
Payne may have leaned towards the Lancastrian party. How-
ever‚ John Payne was not immediately subdued; whether by
open election or by nomination of his predecessor, he became
mayor in 1462.2 Unluckily for the cause of open election,-——if,
indeed, he had championed it,-—Payne’s last mayoralty proved
eminently unsatisfactory. He seems (and this may have added
to his popularity with, at least, one section of the town) to
have been specially adverse to the foreign merchants, always
an important element in Southampton. During his mayoralty
two Venetiam merchants complained that he had seized a cargo
of wine worth ίῳ, on pretence of non-payment of the customs.
The Venetian merchants had produced the acknowledgment of
Robert Belhouse, the customs collector, to prove that the sum
had been duly paid, but in vain. Paynestuck to the goods‚ and
the Venetians appealed to Chancery.3 In the same way the
great Genoese trader, Demetri Spinelli, complained that Payne
had arrested him for the debts os· one Andrew Spinelli, and
had obtained judgment against him in the town court; very
naturally, as Payne himself, as mayor, was one of the judges.4
VVhether in consequence of these and similar accusations, or
whether from some political motive, does not appear ; but at all
events, Payne was deposed from his mayoralty by order of the
king, and was succeeded by Walter Fetplace.⁵

It is possible that Payne's fall marks the disappearance of
the party of free election for the time. At all events, there
are distinct signs of oligarchic development in the reign of
Edward IV. ln the ordinances of this period the consent of the
“commonalty’' seems to have 'been no longer requisite. The
first set, those of 1482—regulating the procedure in ‚the Town
Court,—-were made by the mayor, aldermen, sheriff and three
or four other eX-mayors and sheriffs, together with two bur-
gesses, whose names were given. One of them was subsequently
