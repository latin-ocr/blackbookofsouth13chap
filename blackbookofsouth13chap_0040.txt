XXX. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

 

the Southarnpton tailors cut out and made up. But now these
ships brought not only foreign cloths, but foreign tailors. The
latter pursued their craft aboard the ships when in harbour, or
in shops within the town, without contributing to the local
burdens. Therefore the English tailors petitioned the “con-
gregacio sive assemblement ‘' that no foreign tailor might work
at his craft, in the town or on ships in the harbour, without
making agreement with the masters of craft in the town.
VVhereon the mayor, “by thassent of the aldermen, wise men,
bailiffs and burgesses,'' granted this petition on payment of
a hundred shillings by the tailors’ craft. This sensitiveness
to foreign competition appears to have revived in the Tailors'
Guild towards the end of the fifteenth century. In 1498 six
galley tailors were forbidden to make clothes for any person
not of their own nation¹; and about 1502, according to a
memorandum interpolated at the foot of the above ordinance‚
the tailors were forbidden to take any apprentice not born a

subject of the king.

The tailors were not the only craft to feel the stress of foreign
competition. In a port where the wine trade was of the first
importance the coopers’ craft was naturally prominent; and in
1489 they presented to the mayor, aldermen and other burgesses,
a petition almost identical with that presented by the tailors
eighty years earlier. Their jealousy‚ however, was local, not
merely national; they complain not only of aliens, but of
strange Englishmen occupying shops in Southampton, without
contributing to the town burdens. The coopers quoted the
tailors’ petition as a precedent, and requested that strangers
might be restrained from exercising their craft till they had
“made fyn and gree with the Mayr for the time being and the
maisters of the seid occupacion.‘’ The petition was granted as
that of the tailors had been 3 but with a curious proviso, that if
at any time the coopers did anything injurious to the mayor,
sheriffs, bailiffs, burgesses and community of the town, the
corporation should be able to annul the grant.

Both the tailors and the coopers were clearly old established
guilds; and the cordwainers, who received a grant of powers
and privileges in 1475,2 were probably a growing and increasing
