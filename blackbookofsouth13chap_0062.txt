1 John Pulmond or Polymond, mayor 1365, 1369, 1380-2, 1384, 1385, 1391, and 1392 (J. S. Davies,
Uist. osSouthampton, p. 172) ; Parliamentary burgess, 1364-5,1373, 1380-2, 1384 (ila, p. 201). He was a
merchant and concerned in various more or 1033 piratical 1100111103. Ιο 1377 110 received a pardon 101
having, during four years in the 1331 reign, laden ships at Southampton with 1101303, corn, and herringe,
and sold the same to the king'e 00010103 in Normandy (Par. Rolls Oai„ 1377. p. 79). In 1378,
together with Thomas Bygard‚ the customer, and Williain Malmeshull‚ the bailiff 01 1110 town, he was
charged with having recently seized two ships, 000 of Sluys and one 01 Fowey, and having distrained
011 them on the pretence 01 levying 00310013. He joined with John Flete, Nieholas Langstoke, and
others in forestalling goods to 1110 amount of 2200. and committed various other commercial 11113-
demeanours Cib.. 1378, p. 81). For all these he was pardoned ; and was soon after commissioned to pay
the labourers 11100 at work on southampton Castle an] to 3011 timber 101 that and other expenses
connected with the town fortification (ἰὰ, 1378, p. 281: 1379, p. 313, etc). Polymond had earlier
been associated with the town (10100003, 33 110 had been appointed in 1370, with Hugo de Estote, to
array all the men in the town against the French (J. S. Davics‚ Hist. of Southampton. p. 81) ; his
name was perpetuated 10 that 01 1110 tower at 1110 north-east corner known 33 Polymond's Tower
(ie, p. 101). Ηο had another claim 011 the remembrance 01 1113 fellow townsmen, since in 1381 he built
a new wool-house for weighing wool, and obtained a grant that the king's wool should henceforth be
weighed there (Pat. Rolls Cal„ 1384, p. 476). He was a man of considerable wealth; 110 owned
numerous tenements in the town, and in 1383 lent the king 500 marks to be repam from 1110 0113101113
(ίό, 1383, p. 279).

2 Riehard Bradewey. like PolynmmL frequently held office both 113 mayor, bailiff, 3101173111, and
alderman. He was parliamentary izurgess in 1399 (Davies‚ Hist. of Southampton, p. 201). He seems
to have died in 1415 and to have left a 300, also Richard Bradwey. William wygant acted as 1113
executor, and. in that capacity sold three 1000100013 and five shops, formerly Bradewey‘s, to John
Mascall and Walter Fetplace (ἰὰ, p. 377).

3 Steward. The (1111103 os the steward were, in the main, those 01 a treasurer (J. S. navias, Just.
of southamptom p. 210, also pp. 214 et seq). He received and disbursei the town moneys. Thus the
present Steward‚ Rich-ard Bradewey‚ during a later tenure 01 office (5 Henry IV) received an 301100111-
ledgment 01 the payment 01 11311 the subsidy due 110111 the town—228 133. 311. (Hist. MSS. Com.
Report, XI, Appendix ΙΙΙ, p. 76). About fifty-three stewards' books, ranging in date from the middle
01 1110 reign 01 Henry VI to the time of 01131103 ΙΙ, are still extant (ib.‚ p. 3). The steward seems to
have been orIginaliy an officer 01 the Mei-chuni Guild rather than 01 1110 town (Gross‚ Gilda Μενοίτιον-ἑτι,
Vol. Ι, p. 26) ; certainly this appears to have been the case at Southampton (Oak Book, Vol. Ι, p. xxiv).
