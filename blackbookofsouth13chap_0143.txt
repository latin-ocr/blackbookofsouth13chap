OF SOUTHAMPTON. 97

 

 

Know all men by these presents that Ι, Richard Hausford‚
merchant, of Bristol‚ have remitted, released, and have
altogether quit-claimed for myself and my heirs and executors
for ever to Peter de Pyras, burgess of the town of Southampton,
every kind of actions, real and personal, plaints and applica-
tions which I had, have, or in any way in the future can have,
from the beginning of the world to the day of the completion of
these presents, against the same Peter. In witness thereos Ι
have affixed my seal to this present writing. The witnesses
being Richard Bradewey, John Penkeston‚ Henry Manton, and
many others. Given at Southampton the third day of the
month of March, 8 Henry IV.

Southampton. A meeting called or assembly of the burgesses
held there before william Overey, then mayor there, William
Ravenston, Richard Bradewey, and Henry Holewey‚ aldermen‚
John Beneyt, William Nicholl‚ and Thomas Welles‚ of “the
better men” of the town of Southampton, John Cosyn and
Thomas Armorer, baihffs, on Tuesday, the eve of the Concep-
tion of the Blessed Mary the Virgin, in the eighth year of the
reign of King Henry IV.

At this meeting or assembly John Renaud, Ralph Taylour‚
burgesses and tailors of the town of Southampton‚ and other
tailors of the same town, produced here in court before the said

 

 

they were said to be chosen by the mayor and community yearly to act as justices of the peace (Dama,
Hist. of Southampton‚ p. 238 ; Η. W. Gidden‚ charters of Southamptom Vol. Ι, pp. 48-9).

6 Tuesday, December 7th, 1406.

7 John Remmd, bailiff 1412, mayor-1415. He left a bequest to St. Mary‘s Church ln 1422 of 20]-
for the upkeep ot the fabric or the ehurch, besides a penny for bread for each poor man attending his
funeral, and other similar bequests (navias, Hist. os southampton, pp. 173 and 364). The Terrier ot
1455 shows that he held various tenements in Southampton besides the mansion of Bole Hali: whence
it may be inserted that the rivalry ot the foreign tailors had not seriously impoverished him.

8 Razph Taylour. 'raylour was perhaps the son ot the Ralph Tayior who was Parliamentary
burgess in 1368 (Davies‚ Hist. of Southampton. p. 201), and one of the signatories to the agreement '
with winchester about St. Giles’ Fair (Hist. MSS. Gom. Report, XI, Appendix 111, p. 66). If the
present Taylor is identieai with the Parliamentary humeae, he must have reached a considerable age.
'Phe Parnamentary burgess is presumably the same as the Ralph Tayior who joined with other Seuth-
ampton meniu forestalnng 2200 worth of wine (Pat. Rozle C'aL, 1378, p. 79).
