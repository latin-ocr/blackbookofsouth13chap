Vi. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

 

That the book was viewed as an important record appears
from allusions to it in the deeds and memoranda; the convey-
ances frequently conclude with a request that the deed in
question should he enrolled “in commune papera '’ ; and in an
ordinance in 1503 (Fol. XLIII) it is enacted that the “blacke
booke be all weyes kept under ij lokys”; a command showing
the estimation in which the. book was held.

Despite this value set on the book, it appears to have been
irregularly kept ; the documents it contains are not arranged in
chronological, or any other order. On the first page comes a
list of MSS. written in a variety of hands, ranging in date from
the late fifteenth to the late seventeenth century, as if various
town clerks had written in casual references to manuscripts they
thought important, without in any way attempting to compile a
complete table of contents. Then on Fol. I is a town ordinance
dated 1392, followed by another dated 1413, and a further
number dated 1482.

On Fol. II comes the first conveyance in the book, dated 1392.
The handwriting in all these cases seems to be fairly con-
temporary with the documents‚ leading to the belief that the
town ordinances were inscribed on the first page at the begin-
ning of the fifteenth century, that a fresh page was then taken
on which to enrol the conveyances; and that seventy or eighty
years later the town clerk enrolled a fresh set of ordinances in
the space left by his predecessor——possibly with some idea of
keeping all the ordinances together.

If the town clerk of 1482 had any such plan, the same could
not be said either of his predecessors or his successorS. The
ordinances of 1503 already alluded to appear on Fol. XLIII,
between a release dated 1437 (Fol. XLIII B) and a proof of
age dated about 1434 (Fol. XLII B); and other ordinances
of various dates are interspersed among the conveyances.
These latter deeds, it is true, follow one another in order of
date for several pages, suggesting that each deed was duly
enrolled on its acceptance by the court. Every now and then
a page may have been accidentally left blank, and after-
wards used, which accounts for such interpolations as that
mentioned above. The fairly regular entries continue till the
end of the reign of Henry V. Throughout that of Henry VI
they continue at somewhat longer and more irregular intervals
in point of date, interspersed as before with entries of a
different character, or belonging to a different period. Wills
