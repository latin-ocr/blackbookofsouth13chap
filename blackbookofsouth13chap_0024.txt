XiV. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

 

When the guardians of the law in Southampton thus broke it
at their pleasure, it was to be expected that they should also
twist it to their own ends. The complaints to Chancery during
the fifteenth century suggest that the Town Court was some-
times made an engine of oppression. Thus, in the reign of
Richard ΙΙ a company of Dartmouth merchants complain that
they were robbed of a cargo of woollen cloths and alabaster,
and could get no redress from the mayor and bailiffs of South-
ampton.l Peter James, one of the most important of the
Southampton burgesses, was charged with cheating his own
daughter of land left to her by her first husband. James induced
her to settle the land in question on Nicholas Banastre and
William Soper as her trustees; and these trustees (both men
who, at one time or another, held office in Southampton) then
handed the land over to James.2 John Fleming‚ the mayor of
Southampton, declined to cancel the bond of Edward Catan, a
Genoese merchant, when the latter had fulfilled his bargain,
and demanded payment afresh.3 This last form of cheating
seems to have been very popular: a debtor paid his debt and
demanded the cancelling of his bond; the creditor declared he
had lost it. Subsequently, he apparently found it; at all events,
he would produce it in the town court and sue sor his debt a
second time. Such a trick was played by Thoiras Jamys, of
Southampton, upon John Granysshe, of Islington ; and when the
latter came again to Southampton, James had him arrested and
brought before the court of Pie Powde1·.⁴¹

GROWTH OF OLIGARCHY.

If the administration of justice was unsatisfactory, so was the
administration of finance. The town farm was a heavy drain
on the town’s resources, and complaints of the difficulty of pay-
ment recur throughout the fifteenth century. A state of society
in which there is an ideal of law, coupled with practical law-
lessness, tends naturally to the dominance of the stronger and
more crafty inembers of the community. Unscrupulous men
seize their opportunity 3 and the more scrupulous or more timid
trust that their predominance may bring about some approxima-
