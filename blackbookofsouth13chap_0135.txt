OF SOUTHAMPTON. ' 89

Southampton. Court held there before Richard Bradewey,
mayor, John Cosyn and John MascalL bailiffs there, Tuesday
the Feast of st. Margaret the Virgin, 7 Henry IV.

To this court came Alexander Dey, etc., and brought, etc.,
a certain deed of feoffment, etc. Know all [men]‚ present
and to come, that I, Alexander Dey, burgess of the town of
Southampton, have given, etc., to John Seldere, smsth, of the
town of Southampton, and Cristina his wife, a tenement with
a garden, etc., situated, etc., in the parish of the church of All
Saints within the north gate, in English Street‚‘on the east side
of the street, between the messuage which was formerly a vacant
plot of land of the Precentor of the church of St. Mary (and this
plot the same John purchased from the precentor to hold for
the term of his life) on the south side and the shops of the Abbot
and Convent of Beaulieu on the north side. And the same tene-
ments with a garden and its appurtenances extends from the
said street on the west side to the garden formerly belonging
to John Dounton on the east side. And the same tenement
contains two messuages which formerly belonged to Richard
Gele‚ an ironsmith: to have and to hold all‘ the aforesaid
tenement, etc., to the aforesaid John Seldere and Cristina
his wife, the heirs and assigns of the same John for ever
from the chief lord of that fee, for the rent and services
thence due, etc. And Ι, indeed, the aforesaid Alexander
and my heirs will warrant and defend all the aforesaid
tenement, etc., to the said John Seldere and Cristina his
wife, etc., against all men for ever. In witness whereof I have
affixed my seal to these presents, and for greater safety Ι have
caused the seal of the deanery of the town of Southampton to

Monasticon.v01, V, p. 680-3). The Terrier of 1455 shows Boaulieu as holding four tenements, two
cottages‚ and several bakehouses‚ beside the Wool House in Roehello Lane. In the reign of Henry VII
the monastery seems also to have possessed Bugle Hall (Speed’s Hz'st. os Southampton-E. R. Aubrey
εει-ρ, 122). The monastery also claimed a tun ot red wine yearly from the prisage of wines at
southampton (J. S. Davles, Hiet. of Southamptom p. 220).

⁴ John Dounion, weaver‚ possessed a tenement and curtilage in East Street, granted by the
town (Ηίεέ. MSS. Com. Roport, XI, Appendix ΙΙΙ, p. 70).
