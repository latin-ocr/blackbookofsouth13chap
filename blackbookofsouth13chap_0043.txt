contrary to the custom of London.¹ Further, she inherited lands
and tenements from her husband, father or brother; sometimes
the inheritance was for life merely, as was the custom in other
towns, but sometimes the property became hers absolutely (eg,
Fols. VII and XIX B). As all the deedS‚ by which these powers
of married women were exercised, were accepted by the town
court and enrolled in· the town records, it seems fairly clear that
these customs had all the legal authority the municipality could
give them.

In all these respects Southampton law is individual, though far
from unique ; the law of the realm hardly dealt with the subject ;
each town made its own customs‚ and the Southampton customs
appear on the whole to have favoured ownership by women.
This in itself shews the authority of the town law, for the
current of the time rather went in the other direction: for
example, in 1344 Parliament had petitioned against the making
of wills by married women; and by common law a widow
could have only a life interest in her husband's lands, a custom
which prevailed in London and some other towns.

Thus the maintenance of the Southampton customs in the
case of women points in the same direction as the promulgation
of the trade ordinances, and the importance assigned to the town
records, namely, to the high estimation in which local law was
held as compared with national law. National law was
imposed on the citizens by the state, to be obeyed or evaded
as opportunity or convenience served. Local law they made
themselves to suit their own needs, and in many instances they
respected it. Hence the double aspect presented by Southamp-
ton, as by other mediaeval towns: on the one hand, the organised
law-abiding commufflty, with its disputes decided by its town
court, and its life regulated by its “court assembly'’; on the
other, the congery of vigorous and ambitious merchants and
seamen‚—or‚ in other words, smugglers and pirates—violent,
crasty, lawless and unscrupulous.

It is from these two aspects of the town that the constitutional
changes in its history may spring. The violence and lawlessness
of the time, coupled with the economic development which
concentrated wealth in a few hands, drove men towards sub-
mitting to the rule of an ohgarchy, possibly too wealthy, and
