Midlyngton, then mayor of Southampton, John Cosyn and John
Benet, then bailiffs of the same town, Richard Bradwey, then
steward there, John Flete, william Overey, and many others,
Dated at Southampton the first day of April, in the fifth year
of the reign of King Henry the Fourth after the Conquest. And
this writing being publicly read, heard and understood, and the
aforesaid Joan being examined and sworn before the aforesaid
mayor and bailiffs in the full court aforesaid, according to the
custom of the town aforesaid, purely, freely, and absolutely
owned the said writing to be her doing, and that she voluntarily
caused it to be executed without constraint or coercion from
her husband aforesaid or any other person whatsoever. And
she sought that it be enrolled here in the manner of her
recognisance, according to the custom of the aforesaid town, to
the exclusion of her right and that of her heirs for ever.

Southampton. Court held there before Henry Holewey, then
mayor there, 'and John Cosyn, then bailiff there, on Tuesday
the Feast of Saint Katherine the Virgin‚ 6 Henry IV.

To this court came before the aforesaid mayor and bailiff
in full court Nicholas Chapman, of Southampton, by Thomas
Marleburgh, his attorney, by virtue of a certain letter of
attorney, dated at Southampton, 21st day of the month of
November, in the regnal year above written, and Agnes his
wife in person, and brought then there to the aforesaid court
a certain deed of feoffment, the substance of which deed follows
in these words. Know all [men] present and to come, that we

 

the town bailiffs were given power to grant attorneys. Other rules, however, both in the thirteenth
and fifteenth centuries, provided against abuse by declaring that the attorney must be able to prove
his appointment by the party he represented (Borouoh Customs, Vol. II, p. elii, ete„ and pp. 10-15).
Thus, in the present instance, Marleburgh carefully quotes the letter of attor-noy under which he
acts. Otherwise the whole procedure is, of course, similar to that taKen when the grantor himself
eomes into court.

4 November 21st, 1404.
