XVi. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

 

01 1116 mayor by the burgesses. How Payne’s own election was
managed there is nothing to shew ; but in 1460, when Richard
Gryme, the outgoing mayor, named Walter Fetplace and Nicholas
Holmhegge as the two from whom the bui-gesses should choose
his successor, John Payne, with Nicholas ssagworth, &Valter
Aylward and others, broke into the Guild Hall, at the head of
a party of rioters, forcibly stopped the proceedings and chose
Bagworth as mayor. An appeal was presumably made to the
king by Gryme’s party, as in December, 1460 (111116 111016 111311
two months after the riot), a patent was issued condemning the
action of the rioters, and commanding that the election should
take place according to the ancient custom¹; but despite this,
Bagworth retained the mayoralty. Hence it may, perhaps, be
inferred that the restricted method 01 election was not regarded
as the true constitutional method, at least in the town itself.2
Possibly the townspeople may have regarded the stipulations
for election in the recent charters 01 1445 and 1452 as conferring
real, not nominal‚ powers. But any authority John Payne and
his followers might have derived from those charters was nulli—
fied in the following year, when Edward IV made a new grant
to Southampton, confirming all previous charters, except those
made by the Lancastrian l<ings; but repeating and extending
nearly all the provisions in the Lancastrian grants, with one
notable exception. The provisions as to electiori entirely
disappeared. In face 01 recent events in Southampton such an
omission seems significant; and when it is remembered that
this charter——so adverse to the party of popular election——was
granted as a reward for the town’s loyalty to the Yorkist cause,
it seems just possible that national as well as local politics may
have divided parties in Southarnpton. Some Lancastrian feeling
there was. 111 1461 Edward IV commanded the mayor 01 South-
ampton to. arrest John Bryncheley, servant 01 1116 Duke 01
Somerset, who had been trying to gather forces in support 01

 

1 Patent Rolls (7111, 1460, lJ- 639. The Roll deveribes ι101111 Payne as John Payne, junior: but as
1110 name John Payne occurs 31 intervals in Southaxnpton history from 1408 10 1487, this distinctlon
does 1101 necessarily prevent the identification of the hero ot the riot with the John Payno who was

1113) or in 1450.

·-’ Both Mr. Davies in the History “el‘' Soutlzampton. and Mrs. J. R. Green in Town sze in the
Fis'teenth Centusrynegard the Patent mentioued above as showing that the restricted method of
‹Jlection was a long-established custon1; but this view is, perhaps, opposed by the evidence both 01² the
ordinant-es of 1413 and by the chartei· 011445. When it is renieinbered that the Patent in question was
issuud in a period of the utinost confusion, and within three months after the event which had called 11
forth, it seems possible that the account 11 gives is little more than an echo of the ecc-parte statement
by Richard Gryine and his friends, and does not result froin any judicial investigation into 1110 facts.
