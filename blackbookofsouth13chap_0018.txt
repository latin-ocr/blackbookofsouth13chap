presided over by the mayor and bailiffs, with the assistance of
the aldermen; and the conveyances of land and other trans-
actions between individuals, recorded in the Black Book, were
laid before this court for acceptance before they could be thus
enrolled; but it is noteworthy that various deeds bearing date
1388, 1392, 1397, eto, are said to be laid before “the court’' in
much the same manner as when, after 1401, that court had been
formally recognised by the king's charters.

Certain variations do, however, follow on the grant of the
charter: before that time, while the deed is laid before the
mayor and bailiffs, and sometimes also before the suitors of
the court, the heading os the deed describes the court as presided
over by the bailiffs only; the mayor seems to be present in an
inferior position, as assistant, perhaps, to the bailiffs; aster 1401,
however, the court is almost invariably said to be presided over
by the mayor and bailiffs jointly. The significance of this is to
be found in the peculias position of the mayor in Southarnpton.
As an official of the town he is said to have disappeared in
1249. Then he re-appeared in 1270 as the alderman of the
guild,1 which position he seems gradually to have combined
with that of an osficer of the town. This fusion of the town and
guild government appears to have been taking place during the
fourteenth century. In 1377 an order to put the town in a state
of defence was addressed not only to the bailiffs, who, originally
the king’s nominees, were now the elected governors of the
town, but to the mayor as acting with them; and in 1382 a grant
of pavage was made to the mayor, bailiffs and good men of
Southampton.² Hence the charter of 1401, by which the govern-
ment of the town and the presidency of the town court was
conferred on the mayor and bailiffs‚ was presumably only the
culminating point in a process of gradual fusion between the
town and guild organizations; and the formula used in the
Black Book, whereby the bailiffs alone presided at the court
before 1401, probably bears witness to the last lingering traces
of separation between the two bodies.

As regards the constitution of the court in other respects, it
should be noted that there is a slight difference in its description
before and after 14013 up to that date the suitors of the court
are frequently mentioned3 afterwards the name disappears.
