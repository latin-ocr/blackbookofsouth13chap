HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. iX.

 

 

possibly, the court, previous to the charter of 1401, was in its
nature more nearly akin to the ordinary Manor Court with
the suitors as judges, and needed the transforming touch of the
01131161 before it obtained its full development as a town Court
of Record.

In the same way the jurisdiction of the court seems not to
have been created, but extended and confirmed, by the charter.
It has already been shewn that it fulfilled the function of a Court
of Record before 1401 ; and the grant in the charter of cognisance
over all pleas between burgesses, real, personal and mixed, had
been in part anticipated in 1392 by the very first ordinance in
the Black Book. This ordinance, in its turn, is stated to be the
confirmation of an old custom, since it declares “that among
natives and dwellers within the liberty of the town and bur-
gesses, pleas shall be ended in the king‘s court 01 1116 town,
according to the custom formerly used.'’ Nor is the charter of
1401 the only charter anticipated by this ordinance. The Court
of Pie Powder was only granted by 01131161 111 1461 ; but this
regulation of 1392 demands that “any burgess 01 011161 dweller
..... within the liberty of Southampton shall answer
foreigners or strangers in the plea 01 Pie Powder,⁷' thus shewing
that the Pie Powder Court was a well established institution at
this period. Altogether the evidence in the Black Book shews
that the constitutional development in Southampton was well
in advance 01 1116 10111131 recognition of that development by
the Crown.

GOVERNMENT OF THE TOWN.

As regards officials, other than the mayor and bailiffs, 01 whom
mention is made in the Black Book, there is little of importance
to be noted. Once, and but once, a deed is said to be sealed
by the 5631 01 1116 town reeve (“ sigillum prepositure ”)
instead 01 by the mayor (Fol. IX (2) ); but there is no
other mention 01 11115 functionary, and it is a possible con-
jecture that the use of 1116 word “prepositure '’ instead 01
“ 111310131115” was a mere whim 01 501116 historically minded town
clerk. The town clerks themselves are mentioned occasionally
as signatories to the deedfaagain anticipating the recognition
by charter 01 111611 existence, which did not take place till the
seventeenth century. Mention, however, is to be found of the
town clerk in the early fourteenth century—a date long previous
to the commencement of the Black Book.
