of release, of which the substance follows in these words. To
all the faithful in Christ who shall see or hear the present
writing, John Pakenham and Joan his wife, who was wife of
Henry Machon, late burgess of Southampton‚ eternal greeting
in the Lord. Know ye that we, etc.‚ have for ever completely
quit claimed for ourselves and our heirs to Thomas Armorer‚
burgess of the town of Southampton aforesaid, and lsabella
his wife, all our right and claim that we have, etc.‚ in a
messuage‚ etc., situated in the town of Southampton afore-
said, in English street, on the east side of the street, between
the messuage formerly belonging to John Hayne on the north
side and a messuage that Rennekyn Taillor now holds on the
south side. The west end, indeed, extends to the lzing’s highway
and the east end stretches over the wall of the said town.
So that [neither] we, the aforesaid John Palienhan] and Joan
my wife, nor our heirs‚ nor any one else in our name, shall be
able in any manner in future to enforce or exact any action at
law or claim to the aforesaid messuage, with its appurtenances,
but from all action at law or claim we are excluded for ever by
these presents. And we, indeed, the aforesaid John Pakenham
and Joan my wife and our heirs, will warrant and defend the
aforesaid messuage, with its appurtenances, to the aforesaid
Thomas Armorer and isabella his wife, their heirs and assigns,
against all persons for ever. In witness whereof we have affixed
our seals to this present. And for the sake of greater safety we
have caused the sea] of the mayor’s office of Southampton to be
likewise affixed to this. These being witnesses, Thomas

thus shared the responslbility for the town’s water supply (Davies, Hist. of Southampton, p. 115:
Speed's Hist. os Southampton—E. R. Aubrey eil—pp. 25-31).

3 This elaborate greeting occurs occasionally, though not invariably, ln the leases enrolled lu the
Black Book. A compar-ison of this deed and that ou Fol. VIII (⁶2) will show the points in whlcli the

formulae used ln releases’ ln the Black Book most usually vary. Where “em'’ occurs the formula le
the same in both cases.
