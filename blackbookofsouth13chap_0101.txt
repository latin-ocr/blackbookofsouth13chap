Southampton. At the court held there before John Botiller‚
then mayor, and John Cosyn, then one of the bailiffs of the

On this day came John Deryng, burgess of Southampton‚ and

a certain deed of feoffment, of which the substance follows, etc.
Know all men, present and to come, that we, John Deryng,
etc., and Joan my wife, have granted, ete„ .t0 Master Walter
Aude, parson of the church of St. Michael, of the town of
Southampton aforesaid, our two adjoining tenements situated
in the same town, in the parish of Holy Rood, on the west side
of English Street, between the tenement recently belonging to
Thomas Bawe on the south and the tenement recently belong-
ing to John Florentyn, called Aldeyne, and his wife Joan, on
the north. To have and to hold the aforesaid two tene-
ments, etc.‚ to the aforesaid Master Walter Aude, his heirs
and assigns, of the chief lords of that fee, by the services
thence due, etc., for ever. In witness whereof we have
affixed our seals to this present deed. And for the sake of
greater security we have caused the seal of the mayoralty of
Southampton to be appended hereto. These being witnesses,
John Botiller, then mayor of the said town, John Cosyn, then
bailiff, Thomas Armorer, steward‚ Nicholas Langestoke, John
Flete, Thomas Midlyngton and Thomas Marlebuigh, and many
others. Dated at Southampton, March 26th, 2 Henry IV. And
this deed being publicly read, etc., and the said Joan being
examined thereon alone, etc„ she owns the deed to be her own
doing, and that she, together with her aforesaid husband, caused
it to be executed without compulsion, etc., and asks that the
same deed aforesaid may be enrolled here, etc.

In 1412 he received a patent exemptlng him from the necessity of undertaking any public office
(ἰὰ, 1412, p. 457). Despite this, he continued to hold tho office of bailiff some two years longer. A copy
of thls patent appears ln the Black Book. He was presumably twice married, as the earlier deeds ln the
Black Book speak of his wife as Isabella (Fol. ix b, etc), whlle later deestis refer to her as Matuda
(Fol. xxxviii b, eta). In 1428.9 Armorer‘s name appears as the grantor of a lease (Fol. xl), but he must,
have died before 1430, as in that year mention is made of Matilda‚ widow ot Thomas Armorer, burgess
(Hiet. MSS. C'om. Repora XI, Appendix ΙΙΙ, p. 82).

⁵ Thomas Marleburqh‚ Parllamentary burgess 1394-5‚1402, 1411, 1413-15, 1421, 1422, and 1425-26
(Davies, Hist. os southampton, pp. 201-2).
