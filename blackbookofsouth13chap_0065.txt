John Pyngston, John Skarlet and many others, Dated at South-
ampton on the fourteenth day of the month of July, in the six-

and sealed with the seals of the aforesaid grantors before the
baililf and suitors of the said court, Agnes herself being present

whether this was her own voluntary deed, without compulsion

everything contained in the aforesaid charter is her deed and she
did it of her own free will, and so asks that it may be entered or

the deeds ot teoffment almost invariably begin with the formula, ‘⁴ Sciant presentes et] futuri,'’ releases
usually commence “Noveriut universi,'’ except where this phrase is preceded by some form of saluta-
tion. Forms ot salutation do not usually appear in the deeds of seoffment iu the Black Book.
