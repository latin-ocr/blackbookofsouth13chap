1 There are at least three John Fyssmarks to be discovered in the Southampton necor-ds: John
Fyssmark who was Par-liamentary burgess in 1347-8 and 1350-1 (Davies‚ Hist. of southampton, p. 201)
and the two John Fyssmarks‚ father and son, who made a grant os land in 1439 (Fol. xlix). The
present John Fyssmark may possibly bo a fourth ottho name, ln which case he is probably identioal
with the John Fyssmark who was echevin in 1380 (Oak Book⁷ Vol. ΙΙ, p. 130), and to whom his
brother released various lande and shops in 1376·7 (Hist. MSS. Com. Βερονέ, ΧΙ, Appendix 111, p. 70).
