Black Book, the court-obviously the ordinary town court--is described as a Conrt of Pio Powder:
and if this is not a mere inIstake ot the scribe, it is perhaps evidence that at Soutlmmpton the Court
of Pie Powder was only a session ot the borough court. This view is further borne out by the rule
above, which accords with Dr. Gross's statement that when “it (the Court of Pie Powder) was a
special session oi the borough moot, it sat ..... for the benefit of visiting traders or sti-angers
(extranei) and tried onlv snite in which they were concerned ; plens between burghers were excluded
from its jurisdiction'' (O. (Ji-oss, “The Court ot Pie Powder,’' Quarterly Journal of Economics,
Vol. XX, p. 231. See this Article‚ and M. Bateson, Borouyh Customs. Vol. ΙΙ, Section on “Merchant
and Falr Law,'' for account of Pie Powder Courts). This phrase of Dr. Gross almost exactly expresses
the state of things created by the rule above; and hence it may be inferi-ed that the Southampton
Gourt of Pie Powder existed simply to try causes involving the foreign tradere, of whom many flecked
to the great south country port, and had 110 necessary connection with either fair οι· market.
