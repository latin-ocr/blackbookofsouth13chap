l Election of Officers. By the chartei· of 23 Henry VI, this was to take place on the Fridny
before st. Mattbew·s Day, September 2lst. The above date sliews that the charterii] making this grant
simply confirmed the old custom, as the date of the assembly described in the textis ilie Friday before
St. Matthezv's Day‚ though the scribe prefers to describe it otherwise. It is notewort'ny that this date
differe frou that assigned in the Oak Book (Oi-d. 32) foi· the electiori of bailiffs, «tergenus, etc. Their
electiori was to take place on the morrow after St. Michael's Dar, September 29111. It ie possible that
the alteration oi date may be due to the fusing of the government oi the town and its Guild Merchant,
which is thought to have marked the fourte -nth century. (See charters os Southampton, H. W.
Gidden, σήμ-11111). Southampton Record Society ηῑῙο1, Ι, p. 56, and the Oak Book, P. Studer, eci—pub.

restored church; the site ot Holy Trinity was a little to the south of Chapcl Road. 'l'he site of St.
Ali-lrcw's remeius unknown: the description of certain lands in a fourteentb century cartulary of
St. Denys carries with it the information that St. Andrew's stood a little to tho east οἱ certain granges
belonging to St. Mary's. All three churehes must have stood near together aud a considerable distance
from tue East Gaze. (Β M. Audit. mss„ 15314, f. 76 (1:178) ).
