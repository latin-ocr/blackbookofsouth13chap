2 Friars Minors. The Southampton F'riary was supposed to have been founded in 1253 by
Isabel Chekehull. The chapel stood to the north ot what is now Gloucester square, close to God's
Eouse. The friars were largely instrumental in bringing water to Southampton. The register of the
House preserves many details ot importance in the history of the town. For a full account of the
Friary‚ see J. S. Davies' Hiet. os southampton, pp. 442 et seq„ and Speed's Hist. ofSouthampton
(ed. by Ε. R. Aubrey, pp. 132 et seq.)-

3 John Mascal was presumably the father ot John Mascall who founded Mascall's chantry in Holy
Rood (J. S. Davies, Hist. os Southampton, p. 424). John Mascall, senior, was a man of considerable
wealth, and purchased a large part ot Bradway's property after the latter's death (ib, pp. 376-7). He
was bailiff* ln 1405, 1409, and 1411, mayor in 1414, 1420, ancl 1421, and Parliameutary burgess in
1421-2 (ib., pp. 173 aud 202).

4 It is noteworthy that in this case the right to the land is vested in the heirs os William Nycoll
only, whereas in the maiority of cases the right remains to the heire of the buyer and his wife.
Possibly the fact that (as appears in Note 1) William N ycoll had married a widow with children may
account for this change in the formula, ot which only a few cases occur in the Black Book.
