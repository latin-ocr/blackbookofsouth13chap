OF SOUTHAMPTON. 7

munity of the said town, gathered together for the electiori of
officials, that all prostitutes holding the common lodging house
in Estrete shall be entirely removed from the said street. And
that neither they themselves, nor any other women of the same
way of life, shall be allowed on any other occasion to inhabit or
in any wise to hold any tenement or cottage in the same street,
especially for the sake of preserving the chastity of those passing
through the said street or setting forth abroad to the churches ot
St. Mary, Holy Trinity and St. Andrew ; and that this order
aforesaid may be maintained and observed for ever, they have
caused it to be enrolled in the Black Book of the same town, so
that in future this may be seen to remain on record, etc.

(4). Memorandum‚ that on the 17th day of the month of
October, in the 22nd year of the reign of our lord King Edward
the Fourth after the Conquest of England, it is granted and
agreed by XValter william, then mayor of the town of South-
ampton, Lewys Eynes, John XValker, Walter F etiplace, and
Richard Gryme, then aldermen of the same town, John Ludlow,

 

this ordinance was made. In the course of the year he fle-1 and took sanctuar-y (J. S. Davies, Hist. of
Southampton, p, 175), which may account for the fact that 111 Miss E. R. Aubrey‘s corrected list there
is 110 mayor at, all for 1483, and Lewis Eynes appears as mayor iu 1482 ; whereas speed and ΜΓ. Davies
both give Walter william as mayor in 1482 and 1483 : a statement borne out as far as 1482 is concerned
by this eun-y, especially as Miss Aubrey gives Walter Williani as mayor in 1484. aud her list, as she
notes, is, at this period, a year in advance of Dr. Speed'S. (Speed's Hist. ofSouthampz‘on, E. R. Aubrey,
ed.—Southampton Record society pun—pp. 183, 184.)

9 See last note.

10 John Watker, according to Davles' list, was mayor in 1483, succeeding William when the latter
took sanctuary. He was made gauger at Southampton in 1484, and in the same year received a life
annuity from the king of 20 marks from the Customs at southampton and the adjacent ports. (Patent
Rolle Calendar, 1484, pp. 404 and 431.)

ll Walter Fetpzace. This family had been influential in southampton. A Walter Fetplace is
mentioned as the town steward in 1412-13 (Fol. xviii b 2), and subsequently filled the offices both ot
mayor (Fol. xxix b) and bailiff (Fol. xxii b 2, etc.) 3 and the name recurs in the official lists throughout
the reigns of the house ot Lancaster and Edward IV. The present is almost the latest date at which lt
occurs in the Black Book.

12 Richard Gryme. Davies gives rather more detaits than usual of this alderman; he was
apparently imprisoned in London in 1461, 011 account οἱ the arrears into which the town had fallen 111
the paymeut of its farm (J. S. Davies, Htst. ofSouthampton, pp. 37, 38). He is presumably the sou
ot that Richard Grynie whose obit. was kept at All Saints after 1459 (ib, p. 425). He apparently acted
as town lientenant in 1475, and beat off some French ships 111 that sear (p. 473, ib).

13 John Ludlow was mayorin 1478-9; in this capacity he was joined ln a commission with the
mayor ot Salisbury and a sergeant-avarius to arrest a certain Salisbnry merchant, who was in debt to
some traders of Bourdeaux (Patent Rolls Cal, 1478, p. 145). This point is of interest ln view of

the intercourse and connection between southampton and Salisbury, ot which there are traces in the
Black Book.
