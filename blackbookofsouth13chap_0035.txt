HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. XXV.

 

the difference in the number of persons sharing in the cargoes,
and in the proportion of English to foreign merchants, is even
more striking; in 1433 over two hundred merchants shared in
the lading of the thirty-eight ships entering, and of these nearly
one-third were English; in 1472 the laders of the thirty-five
incoming ships numbered only about half as many, and of these
about a sixth were English.

As regards the outward bound vessels, the thirty-one leaving
in 1433 were laden by about a hundred merchants‚ of whom
one-third were English3 in 1472 the number of the laders of
the twenty-three outgoing vessels was reduced by about one
half, the proportion of English remaining the same—one third.¹

This reduction in the number, both of ships and laders, with no
correspondingly large seduction in the amount of trade, suggests
not only an increase in the size of the ships, but also that
capital was becoming concentrated in a few hands. The fact
that the reduction in the proportion of Englishmen sharing in
the cargoes was greater among the importers than the exporters
further suggests that this rapid growth of great capitalists had
taken place rather in Italy than in England; with the result
that only a feW, comparatively speaking, of the richest of the
Southampton merchants could compete with the foreigners and
maintain their places as sharers in the import trade. The
natural facilities for export possessed by the natives of a
country probably accounts for their having better maintained
their position in this branch of trade.

Incidentally, the view that Southampton men were hard
pressed by foreign competition in the third quarter of the
fifteenth century receives some confirmation from the obvious
hostility to aliens which appears at the end of the reign of
Henry VI and the beginning of that of Edward IV. The
Chancery Rolls at this period are full of complaints by aliens
who had been unjustly treated in the Southampton court, and
in this matter there seems to have been little to choose between
the oligarchic and the popular parties.

If the foreign competition, however, resulted, as it seems to
have done, in the concentration of capital in a few hands, then
it must certainly have tended to oligarchy. If the development
of trade favoured the large capitalist, then tlie concentration of
political would probably follow that of economic power.
