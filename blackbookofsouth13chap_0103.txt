Southampton. Court held before John Cosyn, then bailiff,
on the Monday next after the F east of St. Lucy the Virgin‚

2 Henry IV.

On this day came John Botiller and Isabella his wife, of
Southampton‚ and laid before John Flete, then deputy of the
mayor of Southampton, and the aforesaid bailiff and suitors of
the court, an indented deed of feoffment as follows, etc. Know
all men, present and to come, that we, John Botiller and Isabella
my wife, of Southampton, have granted, etc„ to Thomas Loriner
called Chamberlayn of Grampound, in the county of Cornwall,
a certain tenement called the Niwe In (New Inn) with a garden
and five messuages and adjacent gardens situated in the town
of Southampton, in the parish of the church of Holy Rood, on
the east side of English Street, between the tenement of John
Emmory, junior, on the north and the tenement formerly
belonging to Richard Atte Marche, clerk‚ on the south; and
the same tenement with the messuages, gardens and appurten-
ances extends from the said English Street on the west to the
wall of the aforesaid town on the east. Also we have granted,
eto, to the said Thomas three tenements adjoining one another,
with an adjacent cellar and appurtenances, which are situated
in the said town of Southampton, in the parish of St. Michael,
on the west side of the street called French Street, between a
messuage formerly John Kyngston's on the north and a messuage
belonging to God's House, tenanted by John Brok, 011 the west,
and they (the three tenements) are called Boteleriscorner. More-
over‚ we have granted to the aforesaid Thomas three mes-
suages adjoining one another with adjacent gardens, situated in

4 John Emmory‚junior‚ deputy butler at Southampton 1428 (Pat. Rolle Cal„ 1428, p. 520) and 1433
(ib.‚ 1433, p. ⁴240). He was a merchant and trafficked with Spain, employing a Spanish merchant as his
factor (Early Chancery Proceedings‚ Bundle 16, No. 656). On one occasion he sent out a cargo worth a
hundred marks (ἑὰ). The Port Book οἰ 1428 shows that his exports included cider and flsh and hIs
imports wine and iron. In that year he shared with other merchants in the lading ot numerous
Southampton ships, such as the “ Antony,‘' the “ Gillian” and the “Valentine.'’

⁵ “On the west side.” This description suggests the houses in question were situated at the
junction of French Street with some cross ωσι-0118111310, perhaps Simnel Street‚ and that some part οἱ.
this cross thoroughfare was called Freneh Street. If Freuch Street met this supposed cross street at
right angles and continued northward some little way to the east of its first junction with the cross
street; then if Boteleriscorner occupied the angle at the junction between the northern part of French
Street and this presumed cross thoroughfare, it might possibly be described as iying between a
‘ tenement in French Street on the north and another tenement-also in French Street—on the west.
