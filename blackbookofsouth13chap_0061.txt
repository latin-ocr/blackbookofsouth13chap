3 Baiziff. The bailiffs were in the first instance the king's Officers in the town (Davies, Hist. os
Southampton, p. 163). Their business was to execute the king's command and presi-ie over his courts.
They are first mentioned in the enar-ter of 1252 (Charters of Southampton, Vol. I, p. 6). By the tlme
ot the Oak Book Ordinances they had become elected Officers, being chosen by the twelve discreets
(Oak Book, Ord. 32). Their duties remalned tho same: to execute the king's commands and to do
iustlce (ib.) ; and to collect and pay over the customs (ἰὰ, Ords. 33 et seq). They took cognisance of
debts (ib., Ord. 27), and were associated with the mayor and aldermen in administering trade regula-
tions (ib, Ords. 27 and 31). Together with the mayor they presidet] at the town courts, as appears ln
the Black Book. In 1445 their election was placed, like that of the mayor, iu the hands ot the

burgesses (Charters of Southampton, Vol. I, p. 56).
