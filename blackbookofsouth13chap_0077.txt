of the subsidy of 2l- per tun on wine and 611. per lb. on all goods except wool and hides 111 1383
and 1390 (ib.. p. 329; 1390, p. 241), and 111 1383 was controller of the works at Southampton Caatle
(ib, p. 324). Iu 1388 he was controller of the custom of 31- a tun on wine and 12d. 011 other gomis,
granted by 1116 last Parliament (ib.‚ p. 455).

5 Thomas M idlynqton, mayor 1401-3, Parliamentary bui-gese 1399 and 1402 (J. S. Davies, Hist. of
Southampton, pp. 173 and 201-2). Midlyngton was a wealthy man and a well-known burgess; he was
a considerable landowner, and acted as executor of John Polymond (Hist. MSS. Gom. Report, XI,
Appendix III, p. 74). He appears at various times as plaintiff in pleae of debt (eff, Pat. Rolls Cal„
1410, p. 132). A more important 111·οοί of his wealth appears in the fact that he was chiefly responsible
for the construction ot a new whart, with a craue, near the Watergate (ἰὰ, 1411, p. 283). This whart
created some indignation among the Salisbury and winchester merchants, who complained that they
were thereby hinde1·ed from landing at the Watergate (ib., 1410, p. 310) ; but Midlyngton's whart was
apparently retained, since the mayor and burgesses were commanded to keep it 111 repair, charging the
merchants who used it such sees as were usual in London and elsewhere for the use of a wharf and
crane (ib, 1411, p. 283).
