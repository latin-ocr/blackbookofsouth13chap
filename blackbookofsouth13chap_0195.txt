hardly probable that this continuatim] of Broad Lane should be Halveknyghtes Lana, as Broad Lane is
nowhere given as oue of the aliases of this many-named street; and, nioreover, its did not lie in the
parish of Holy Rood. The map of 1770 shows two uunamed lanes running westward from ngh Sti-eet,
or English Sti-eet, and lying to the north ot Broad Lane; possibly Cokorewelane may 116 identified
with one of these and Remota-lane with the other.
