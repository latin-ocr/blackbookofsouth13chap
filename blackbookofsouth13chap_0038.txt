xxviii. HrsTochL INTRODUCTION.

 

 

Some accumulations 01 land there were, chiefly in the hands
of the town and of the great religious houses in the neighbour-
hood, like Beaulieu and St. Denys. A few great burghers
possessed nine or ten tenements3 many had two or three; some
both owned and leased houses, and there was a good deal of
sub-letting ; but altogether there must have been nearly half as
many landlords as tenants in 1455, though, 01 course, the tenants
do not include persons lodging with householders, among whom
various foreign traders must have been included.

Neither the Terrier nor the deeds in the Black Book suggest
any notable increase in population during the fifteenth century.
There are occasional traces of new building: William Soper,
for instance, built a tenement near 1116 Friars’ cemetery; but
during the whole century there are frequent mentions of vacant
land within the walls of Southampton. Vacant places—of all
sorts of odd shapes and sizes—occur in English Street and
French Street, and above all in Simnel 511661 and about the
VVest Quay; while East 511661 was largely a street 01 orchards
and gardens. There were gardens likewise in English Street
and French Street. Outside the walls there were a few houses
in Bovebar'Street (Above Bar), such as the New lnn, just north
01 1116 Bargate ; but in the main Above Bar seems to have been
a country road bordered by the arable plots and common lands
belonging to the Southampton burgesses. Such a state 01 things
could hardly have persisted had there been any great growth in
the numbers 01 1116 inhabitants.

Thus the ownership 01 lands or tenements could not have
brought with it the power wielded by landlords in more
crowded cities; and the constant changes of ownership must
have disposed men in favour 01 a fairly wide constitution, since
it prevented the creation 01 a class 01 hereditary landowners,
whose position 01 economic privilege might have conduced to
their exclusive possession 01 political power.

The tendency, therefore, to the division of landed property
may in some degree have counterbalanced the effect of the
concentration of capital, and so have helped to render possible
the constitutional revival: and in the same way the disregard
01 national law evinced by the Southampton burgesses, which
presumably tended to oligarchy, may to some extent have been
counterbalanced by their respect 101 1116 laws 01 1116 town.

The very revival 01 1116 0111 formulae in the later ordinances
in the Black Book shews a certain stability in Southampton
