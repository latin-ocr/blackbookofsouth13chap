HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. Vll.

 

occur but rarely till the latter part of the reign of Henry V1;
the greater number belong to the reigns of Henry VII and
Henry VIII. For the reign of Edward IV there are very
few entries of any kind, but during the reign of Henry VII
they become more numerous, and a fair number of
conveyances and wills appear in the reigns of the early
Tudors, together with numerous town memoranda of consider-
able importance. The entries decline during the reign of
Elizabeth ; and only one—the last entry but one in the book—-
appears in the Stuart period. This is dated 1620. Altogether,
it may be said that the period during which the book was kept
with the greatest regularity ends with the end of the reign of
Henry VI.

This miscellaneous and unmethodical arrangement of the
book appears so characteristic and significant that it has been
retained (with a few trifling exceptions) in the present edition.
For convenience of publication, it has been necessary to make
a division of the whole into volumes‚ but this division is purely
arbitrary; and were the three volumes bound in one, the
succession of documents would be almost precisely that of the
Black Book.

The contents of this first volume consist mainly of convey-
ances of land, with a few town and trade ordinatrices, and one
will—that of Richard Mey, dated 1392. The greater number of
these documents belong to the end of the fourteenth and the
beginning of the fifteenth century, but there are a few records of
later date. Like the other records in the Black Book, these
give hints of the constitutional‚ social and topographical aspects
of Southampton; and when compared with external evidence
as well as with the deeds which will fill the later volumes‚ they
give some idea of the development of the town in the fifteenth
century.

THE TOWN COURT.

The earlier documents in the Black Book at once raise a
question as to the government of Southampton; they suggest
the possibility that the Southampton charters frequently only
confirmed practices already well established. The charter
under which the town was governed during the first forty-five
years of the fifteenth century was that granted by Henry IV in
1401.1 By this charter a Court of Record was established,
