4 ‘⁵ Pro sua dote.” This is the only deod ln the Black Book in which the wife disclaims right on
account of dower ; and 11: is noticeable that she has had no share iu the making of the grant. It may

chaslng the land jointly, or by the wife's inheritance‚ whereas iu the present case the wifo’s claim was
presumably only the general claim to dower from her husband's kinds, which in various modified
forms was general throughout the country. Many towns—such as Northampton and Nottingham-
had rules whereby widows were unable to claim (lower from lands auena-ted by their husbands for
their joint beneflt (M. namon, Borouah Customs, Vol. ΙΙ, pp. 103-5).
