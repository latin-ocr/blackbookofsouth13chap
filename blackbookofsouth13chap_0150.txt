2 The word thus translated is “communitas“ This entry ιε interesting, as the formal right to
hold lands was only granted to the town ln 1415 (H. W. Gnidon, Char-tere of Southampton‚ Vol. Ι,
pp. xffl and 38). This suggests that, as was the case with other points ln the chartei-s, the grant merely
implles the legalisatlon of an exlstlng practice.
