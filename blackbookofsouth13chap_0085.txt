5 Fossam castri. The Castle moat surrounded the Castle wall, and the wall, according to a niap
ot 1611 (Soutlzampton Atlas, Soutllalnpton Record Society pub.) lay north of Sinmel Street. It ran
east from the west wall of the town till it was nearly opposite the point where Simnel Street joined
French Street, and then, curving northward, ran up to the north wall of the town. The Castle was
repaired andlargely rebuilt in the reign of Richard II. The burgesses were closely associated with
the works. Several documents exist directing Polymond, Bacon, and other well-known burgesses hold-
ing office in the town to pay the labourers engaged on the fortifications and to sell timber to provide
for the expenses (Pat. Rozls Cal., 1378, pp. ‘241 and 264; 1379, p. 313). A warrant was further issued
in 1396 to arrest labourers and masons in the county and to set them to work on the fortifications
(ib, 1390, p. 244). Uniuckily. the connection of the bui-gesses with the works was not wholly satisfac-
toi-y, as in 1389 they are accused of misapplyiug the money raised for the fortificationis (ib.‚ 1389,
p. 57-8). The connection between the burgesses and the fortificationis is perhaps shown by the names
ottho various towers‚ which 111 1455 stlll bore the names of burgesses who had been prominent fifty
years earlier, such as Armorer’s Tower. Mlddlyngton's Towe1·,ete. ( Audit House MSS. Terrier, 1455),
