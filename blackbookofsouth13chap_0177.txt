bailiffs‚ John VVetonhulle, steward there, John Hachard‚ John
Notebeme, John Seldere and many others. Dated at ⁴South-
ampton, the 26th day of the month of October, in the thirteenth
year of King Henry the Fourth after the Conquest. And this
release and acquittance being publicly read, eto, in the court
aforesaid, the same Margery being examined and sworn by
herself alone, eto, declared the aforesaid release and acquittance
to be her own deed and act, eto, and asks that it may be
enrolled, eto, and it has been granted to her, etc.

That deed aforesaid is cancelled and void because the afore-
said Reginald and Cristina had the said tenement from the gift
of the said John Beneyt and Margery his wife, on condition if
the said Reginald and Cristina had paid to the said John and
Margery on the Feast of St. Katherine the Virgin‚ the neit after
the date of the aforesaid deed, twenty-two pounds of sterling
money, that then they should have the said tenement for ever.
But if not, then it should be lanul for the said John and
Margery to re-enter the said tenement, and to possess it them—
selves for ever, eto, and this money the said Reginald and
Cristina have paid neither at the said feast nor at any time
afterwards. So the said John and Margery have re-entered the
tenement and enfeoffed diverse persons therewith‚ as appears on
the other side of that page and the next, eto, and so that deed
aforesaid remains void for ever.

 

4 These conditione do not appear in the former deed.
