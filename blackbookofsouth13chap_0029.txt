who had a hereditary connection with the town as the possessor
of the tronage and pesage, may have contributed to this result.
In 1470 Warwick attempted to seize a ship of his own at South-
ampton, but was defeated by Lord Scales3 and the Earl of
W'orcester subsequently executed with characteristic cruelty1
several of Warwick's men seized in the ships at Southampton;
despite which, &Vax-wick's vice—admiral visited the town in the
following year,2 and was there seized by the Duke of Gloucester.
Twelve years later two eX-mayors of Southampton, Walter
Williams and William Overay, and a prominent burgess, Roger
Kelsale, were impeached for sharing in Buckingham’s rebellion‚
though they were subsequently pardoned.

XVhether or no as the result of the fall of the Yorkists, a
revival of old constitutional forms clearly took place in South-
ampton during the reign of Henry VII. It is noteworthy that
during this reign many of the old guild ordinances were re-
issued and supplemented by the reforming mayor, Thomas
Overay.3 The question of election revived. Overay’s ordinances
distinctly state that the election of the jurats shall be made
by the “hole Assembly.'' Investigation was made also into
the town customs, and the dues demanded on wine and oil
were reduced by one half, i.e., to the standard set up by
the list of tolls issued in 1381. The Erokage Book-s were
again more carefully and more fully kept; and the descrip-
tion of the authorities issuing the town ordinances also
suggests a reversion to old practice. It is true that on one or
two occasions (once at the end of 1482) they are simply said to
be issued by the “mayor and his brethren‚’' or the “mayor and
his companions‚‘' which may mean anything or nothing. But
the culminating point in what may possibly be a constitutional
revival was the issue of the financial ordinances in 1503.4 These
ordinances distinctly limit the mayor's powers. On condition
of receiving a yearly salary of [IQ he is to cease to “ resceyve
or handill any of the Townys money.'’ He is to make no fines,
save in association with the aldermen and discreets; the town's
money is to be in the charge of the under-steward; and the
expenses undertaken are to be at the mayor's command indeed,
