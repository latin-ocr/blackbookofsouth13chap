xxvi. insTochL INTRODUCTION.

 

The end of the century, however, apparently witnessed a slight
return to the more widely spread trade of the earlier period.
By about 1492 trade seems to have revived somewhat, though
in a rather different form. The trade in cloth and wine had
decreased; but the export of wool had again risen, and that of
tin had enormously increased. The chief dealers in the latter
were the Venetian merchants, who were beginning to replace
the Genoese as the chief Italian traders with Southampton.
The imports, as before, are largely articles of luxury, and the
chief increase is in exportS. The ships do not seem to have
increased in number, but the laders did, and there was a slight
rise in the proportion of English importers, thereby suggesting
a greater diffusion of wealth in Southampton than had
previously been the case.

The inland trade shews a similar revival. The entrance of
carts laden with wool into the town is, perhaps, a more marked
feature of the Brokage Book of 1493 than of any of the earlier
books. On the other hand the change in the nature of the
imports is manifested by the increase in the wine taken over-
land from Southampton, and the diminution of woad. To
counterbalance this, tin was taken overland to London, and

numerous carts full of costly textiles also appear in these
accounts.

Thus if the concentration of economic power coincided with
and contributed to the concentration of political power, the
constitutional revival may have been accompanied by a greater
diffusion of wealth.

This latter variation seems, however, too slight to have been
the cause of the constitutional revival in question; but there
were other forces at work in Southampton which may have
made for the renewal of the older constitutional forms.

OWNERSHIP OF LAND.

In the first place, the possible concentration of wealth noted
above does not seem to have been rendered permanent by
investment in such a shape as to create a hereditary propertied
class. The chief form of investment was naturally in land;
and to this the Southampton burgesses‚—as the deeds in the
Black Book shew,—had recourse. Rising burgesseS, such, for
example, as william Soper or John Selder the smith, appear in
