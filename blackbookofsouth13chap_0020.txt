X. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

 

 

Other officials or semi-oflicials mentioned are the aldermen,
the echevins‚ the steward, the discreets‚ and the jurats. The
aldermen appear colitinually‚ both as witnesses to deeds and
as assenting to ordinances, but only after their creation by the
charter of 1401. The echevins (who were guild officers) appear
once in 1392 at a “common assembly or association of bur-
gesses‚’' before whom a will was proved. The echevins in the
fourteenth century were associates of the steward or treasurer.
The latter officer almost invariably appears as a witness to the
deeds in the Black Book. An ordinance of 21 Henry VII gives
some explanation of his duties and powers (Fol. XLIII). The
discreets, or “probiores homines,’⁷ also appear occasionally in the
Black Book as assenting to the ordinances, but they are not
specified as regular attendants at the town courts, neither are
the jurats, who also occasionally give assent to the ordinances.¹

The assembly at which these two last named sets of officials
appear is in its way an even rnore important body than the
town court. It is the “congregacio sive assemblernent,” by
which the town ordinances were made. The constitution of
this Southampton Parliament seems obscure. Ordinance 32 in
the Oak Book states that the whole community are to assemble
yearly to consider the common business of the town and to
elect twelve discreets‚ who in turn chose the bailiffs. The
earliest ordinance in the Black Book was made by the mayor
and community; in 1413 an ordinance was put forth by the
mayor, aldermen‚ bailiffs and community assembled in “a court
called in the vulgar assemble,” for the election of the town
officers; and about the same time land is distinctly stated to
belong to the mayor and community (Fol. XIII B, 9 Henry IV).
Clearly, therefore, at the beginning of the fifteenth century the
government of the town did not rest entirely with the officers,
nor were the functions of the townspeople limited wholly to the
election of their executive. This election was, indeed, part of
their duties (and here again the town custom anticipated the
royal grant3 there is no mention of any election in the charters
till 1445). But the same body which elected the officers seems
to have formed also the legislative body of the town; and the
question arises as to whom this body included. There were at
this time in Southarnpton two sets of persons—an inner body of
burgesses, and an outer ring of “franchisers,''—dwellers in
