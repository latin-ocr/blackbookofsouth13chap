before Walter Longe, then mayor, and the aforesaid bailiff and .
the suitors of the court, a deed of feoffment of which the
substance follows, etc. Know all men, present and to come,
that we, John le Forester, of Romsey, and Elizabeth my wife,
have granted, etc., to John Bigard, of Southampton, a messuage
with a curtilage and a dovecot, together with a field called
Bradecroft, with all its appurtenances within the liberty of
the town of Southampton aforesaid, as they are enclosed by

into southampton (Pat. Bous Gal„ 1377, p. 93). Fur-ther, John F'orester is probably the same as the
John Forester made J ustlce of Peace for Hampshire iu 1389 (ib., 1389, p. 137).

4 John Bigard, Parliamentary burgess 1388 (Davies, Hz‘st. os Southamptom p. 201).

⁶ Bradecroft. It is obvious from the context that the land here mentioned all lay on the west
outside the walls, since Bradeeroft lay near Gosenwene Lano. which is now Waterhouse Lano (Davles,
Hist. os southampton, p. 450).
