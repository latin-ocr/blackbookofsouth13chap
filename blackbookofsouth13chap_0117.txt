OF SOUTHAMPTON. 71

otherwise called Clerk, brother of the same Juliana, for the term
of his life, and that after the death of the aforesaid Walter and
william VVellys the aforesaid tenements should be sold by the
executors of the aforesaid Juliana or by the executors of their
executors, as in the same will is more fully manifest: to have
and to hold the reversion of the said two tenements with the
cellars built below, and with all their appurtenances, when it
shall fall in after the death of the aforesaid &Valter and william
Wellys‚ to the aforesaid John Deryng and John Mascall, their
heirs and assigns sor ever from the chief lords of that fee, by the
services thence due and customary according to law. In witness
whereof I have placed my seal to this present deed. The
witnesses being Thomas Midlyngton, then mayor of the town
of Southampton‚ John Flete, Walter Lange, william Overey‚
John Botssler, Aldermen, Henry Holewey and William Nicholl‚
then bailiffs there, Nicholas Langestoke‚ John Lymborner‚ and
many others. Dated at Southampton on the Feast of St. Mary
Magdalene, 3 Henry IV. And this deed having been seen, read
and heard, the attornment of the reversion aforesaid has been
declared after the death of the aforesaid Walter and William
according to the custom of the town, saving the right of any
one whatsoever. And thereon seisin has been granted according
to the form of the aforesaid deed, saving the right of any one
whatsoever, etc„ according to custom, etc.

⁶ “Attornamenta rever·s10n1s.'' The process ot attornment was the process by which the tenants
01· the land (in this case apparently Thomas Montagu and William Bljk) consented to the transfer of
their services from one lord to another. It was necessary to a complete transfer ot land (Pollock and
Mam-and, Hist. of Enqlz'sh Law, Vol. Ι, p. 348, Vol. ΙΙ, pp. 93 and 132). In the present case the attorn-
ment (··seeundurn v111e”) seems to be the work or the court, and nothing is said here about the
presence or consent of the tenant iu the matter: whereas in some boroughs‚ though the process ot
attornment was the work of the court, yet the tenant's presence at the court by which he was attorned
was usually considered necessary (Batesom Borouyh Customs, Vol. Ι, p 315, ete). Possihly ln the
present case the phrase “ seeundum cousuetudinem ville ” ma)- cover a summons to the tenant and his
formal assent.
