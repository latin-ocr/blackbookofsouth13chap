xii.HISTOR1CAL INTRODUCTION.

 

persons who were qualified for burgess-ship‚ but not yet chosen?
There is no evidence to shew, but the evidence of the Black
Book tends to prove that, whatever were the necessary qualifica-
tions, burgess-ship was fairly widely distributed. The majority
of men whose names occur in the deeds and memoranda are
described as burgesses, and some who are not so described, when
their names first occur, apparently attained to the dignity after-
wards. Thus, there is some ground for doubting the view so
ably maintained by Mrs. Green, that Southampton in the early
fifteenth century was governed by a close and narrow oligarchy
and an almost despotic mayor. As a general rule, royal patents
and commands are addressed to the “mayor, bailiffs and good
men‚'' or to the “mayor and burgesses’'; the few occasions
on which the precept is addressed to the officers alone is when
it is a command for the definite execution of some particular
act. Thus the burgesses appear to act with the officers whom
they elect and to share with them the responsibility for town
legislation3 and these burgesses were by no means necessarily
a narrow or exclusive body.

Hence the picture given by the records in the Black Book
shews Southampton‚ at the beginning of the fifteenth century,
as a community possessing some degree both of sels-government
and of local independence. Its court had jurisdiction over all
causes among its own citizens; the town assembly could make
ordinances regulating trade and industry3 the town could
impose tolls and other taxes for its own support, and could
negotiate and arrange terms of trade with other towns; and
finally, these powers were in the last resort vested, not in a close
corporation, but in a fairly large body of burgesses, who elected
the officers, and whose assent was necessary to the making of
the town ordinances.

LocAL AND NArioNAL LAw IN SOUTHAMPTON.

This local sels-government and independence may account for
the mixture of law and lawlessness which the history of South-
ampton at this time presents. On the one hand the Black Book
gives a view of a town in which industry is regulated by public
ordinances; important transactions between individuals are
publicly registered; disputes are referred to a legal tribunal;
attention is paid to public morals; and the whole community
seems to live under strict order and regulation. But a very
different picture is presented by evidence from other sources.
