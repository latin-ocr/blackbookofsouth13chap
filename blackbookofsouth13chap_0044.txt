so too powerfuL to be ruled themselves by their fellow towns-
men. On the other hand, the loyalty to local law made a
counteracting force to national lawlessness‚ by giving a certain
stability to the older constitution of the town The diffusiori
of land counterbalanced the concentration of capital3 and thus
when greater general tranquility and a slightly wider diffusion

Before closing this preface to the first volume of the Black
Book, I wish to say a word of thanks to Mr. H. W. Gidden, MA.
and Professor Studes, D.Litt., the editors of the Southampton
Record Society. Their help and kindness all through the work
have been invaluable, and has greatly facilitated my task.

As the present editor of the Black Book, Ι can claim only a
part of any credit which may 136 annexed to the undertaking.
Two antiquaries have preceded me in the task‚—the late ΜΓ,
Clutterbuck and Miss Sims, M.A.,——and their work has been
most kindly placed at my disposal. Their transcripts covered

were exceedingly full and clear, they did not require more than
the comparison and revision all transcribers feel necessary to
perfect their work. Hence the transcripts in the present volume
of the Black Book are in the main due to Miss Sims. l owe her,
therefore, very sincere thanks for permitting me to use the result
of her labours, whereby my task has been greatly facilitated.

For the summaries, abstracts and notes, Ι am entirely
responsible.

formal phrases which have already been given in other deeds
in the book; and that where the document is headed “Sum-
marised’' or “ Abstracted‚’' the contents alone have been briefiy
given, as the form presented no points of interest.
