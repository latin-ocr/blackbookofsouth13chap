craft. Southampton did a considerable trade in hides, especially
in their import, probably on account of the growth os this craft.
As early as 1399 there is an indenture for binding a country
youth apprentice to a Southampton cordwainer for six years¹3
and this trade, too, was apparently practised by aliens. A list
of foreigners resident in Southampton in 1436 gives the name of
a Dutch cordwainer.2

Thus it is clear that whatever weakness there might be in
enforcing the general laws of the realm in Southampton, the
craftsmen of the town considered the local authorities competent
to protect their private and local interests. It is noteworthy
that the only appeal by the Southampton craftsmen to the crown

at this period appears to have been by the tailors in the reign
of Edward IV.

Another curious instance of the authority of the town in
industrial matters is shewn by the ordinances issued in 1503
with regard to wool packing.3 The packing of wool for trans-
port seems at Southampton to have been entirely in the hands
of women, under the supervision apparently of the corporation.
The ordinance regulating this industry was issued by the mayor
and other officials with the assent of the commonalty‚ and
provides that twelve women should be appointed to “ serve the
marchaunts in the occupacyon of coueryng of pokes or balons.”
The ordinance provides for a due division of the work, and the
due “warnyng’' by the women of each other when work is
wanted. The women are yearly to choose two of their number
to be wardens of their company; vacancies in the company
are to be filled by nomination of the mayor and corporation;
and the women were to “worke the balons and pokkes with
their own handes . . . . and not to bawle nor scold oon
with anither.’' These imperative ordinances present a curious
contrast to the independence of the men’s guildS‚ but they serve
to shew the importance of the industry of wool packing in
Soufflampton, and form another item in the body of local
industrial law under which the town lived.

and was kindly communicated to me by Professor Studer.
