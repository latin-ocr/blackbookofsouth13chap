Southampton‚ but not possessors of full burgess rights,1
especially as regarded trade privileges. But were these
“franchisers” included inthe “coinmunity'⁷ who elected the
jurats and assented to the ordinances? Probably they were.
In 1414 a patent granting Thomas Armorer exemption 110111
office was enrolled by assent 01 1116 burgesses and community3
in 1503 the burgesses and “coinnalty'’ both assent to the
ordinances. On the other hand the trade ordinances 01 1406
and 1487 are made by assent 01 1116 town officers and bur-
gesses only. Possibly trade ordinances required only the assent
01 1116 guildsmen; but 1116 616011011 01 officers and ordinances
concerning the whole town may have been made by both
burgesses and franchisers.

The importance 01 the franchisers would obviously depend on
the nature 01 1116 qualifications 101 burgess-ship ; where this was
fairly easy 01 31131111116111 persons who were outside its pale
would be comparatively few. In earlier times, at least, the
qualification for burgess-ship was 1101 hard 01 31131111116111. Μ1.
J. S. Davies says 11131 10 3113111 10 bur-gess-ship a man must be a
resident househoffler, 3 member 01 1116 town court, and a con-
tributor to the town burdens ; and this qualification apparently
continued throughout the fifteenth century3 since late in that
century Damyan de Peyza stated in a Chancery petition that
he had lived fifteen years in Southampton, paid scot and lot,
and been sworn in as a freeman.2 On the other hand it seems
certain that “ burgess ’' was sometimes, at least, used as the equiv-
alent of guildsman. Membership 01 1116 Μ610113111 Guild was
inheritable by the eldest son 01 3 guildsman, or attained by
the younger sons on payment 01 rol-‚ or granted by the discreets.
But 110 man could become a guildsrnan by purchase 01 111 right
011115 wife. These were the fourteenth century regulations in
the Oak Book. In the Modern Laws issued in 1491 exactly the
same stipulations are made concerning burgesses; but there is
no statement as to the original qualifications 101 3 burgess or
guildsman. Did a man become a burgess as 01 right 31161 3
period 01 residence in the town and after certain contributions
to the town burdens, or had he invariably to be chosen by the
discreets‚ and did the “comynaltie’' 01 residents 00115151 01
