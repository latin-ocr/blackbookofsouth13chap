XVlli. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

 

that formally adopted more than two hundred years later, when
in 1730 it was decided that the Common Council should consist
of eX-officials.¹ In the fifteenth century, however, the arrange-
ment does not seem to have remained in force. The rule of the
men who succeeded Payne was no more satisfactory than his
own, to judge by the complaints in the Chancery petitions.
Fetplace, like Payne, was accused of using his position as mayor
to obtain judgments in his own favour and that of his friends.
John Walker, the sheriff, was charged with imprisoning a Vene-
tian merchant, to make him sell cotton at his (Walker’s) price3
and John Nedeham, who was sheriff a few years later, was also
charged with bringing an action against a Spanish merchant,
and trying it before himself.2

In other respects‚ too, there are traces that the administration
of the town had rather deteriorated than improved. For example,
the Brokage Books or accounts of the tolls levied on goods
passing through the Bargate, which, up to 1460, had been kept
with great clearness and fullness of detail, certainly fell off
towards the end of the reign of Edward IV. The names of the
consignees are omitted, and day after day is left blank with-
out any explanation of the hiatus3 nor are the several items
generally given, as heretofore, of the goods in question, but they
are frequently lumped under the convenient heading “divers
merchandise.’' In the same way the Black Book shews traces of
neglect at this period. The entries for the reign of Edward IV
are very scanty3 and the most interesting of them suggests an
unsatisfactory state of things. In 1483 Lewis Eynes and John
Shropshire, both of whom at different times were mayors of
Southampton, were charged with seizing the goods belonging
to one John Ward, “combaron” of the Cinque Ports, and to
John Filpott. The Cinque Ports took up the quarrel, and sent
a letter to Southarnpton demanding redress; to which South-
ampton replied that if the complainants would come to the
town court of Southainpton, justice should be done: a state-
ment the truth of which seems doubtful.

Altogetlier the impression given by the records is that this
was a period of slack administration. As time went on it
seemed as if Southampton shared in the general revolt against
the Yorkist domination. The influence of the Earl of VVarwick,
