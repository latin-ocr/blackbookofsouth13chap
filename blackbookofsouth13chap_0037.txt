deed after deed as the purchaser of tenements in Southampton ;
but this process does not seem to have led to the permanent
concentration of land in a few hands. A study of Southampton
wills partly explains this phenomenon. The first will in the
Black Book, that of Richard Mey, provides that his lands shall
go to his son for hfe; and shall then be sold for the benefit of
his soul. Other wills leave the lands to the wife for life with
a similar proviso; thus accounting for the deeds in the Black
Book which shew the widow, in conjunction with her second
husband, disposing of her first husband's tenements. Even where
the bulk of the tenements are to go to the children after the
wife’s decease, there is frequently a proviso that some part of
them shall be sold sor pious purposes. The view that there was
no special tendency for land to follow the example of capital
and accumulate in a few hands is, on the whole, confirmed by
a Terrier or Survey of Southampton made in 1455, and now in
the Audit House of the town. This document is a description
of the tenements of Southampton within the walls, giving the
names both of the tenants and of the owners thereos, together
with a description of the particular part of the defences, with
the maintenance of which each tenement was charged. This
charge, when tenements change hands, is presumably covered
by the formula occurring invariably in the conveyances in the
Black Book, by which the feoffee is to hold the lands by all
the lawful and customary services. In a large number of cases
the names of two or three persons who successively owned the
land are given ; and as far as can be gathered by a comparison
of the numbers of these past owners with those holding the
same tenements in 1455, the class of landowners had neither
’ increased nor diminished during the fifty years previous to
1455. On the whole there is an increase, if anything, in their
number; and that no tendency towards the accumulation of
lands in a· few hands existed during the latter part of the
century is suggested by the fact, that towards the end of the
κ period, an entirely new set of names appears among those of
the leading burgesses and town officials. OverayS, Flemings
and Chamberlains do, indeed, persist ; but the names of Payne,
Aylward, Florys, Bedel, which had been prominent in 1450,
are replaced about 1490 b'y Gunter, Tehy‚ Walker, Spring and
others. Thus it seems possible that the custom of the sale of
tenements after the death of the owner prevented the creation
of a hereditarily wealthy class in Southampton.
