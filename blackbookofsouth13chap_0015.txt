THE BLACK 3001< OF SOUTHAMPToN—so called from its black
leather cover-—is a thick volume 15} inches by 11} inches,
composed of about a hundred and fifty-two leaves of paper,
of which about two-thirds have been more or less well
filled. In some cases the page is written from top to bottom
with an allowance for margin, but, generally speaking, each
fresh document commences on a fresh page. The leaves are
written on both sides, but are numbered on one only; for
convenience, the reverse side of every leaf has been called leaf
B in the present edition—Fol. I, Fol. I Β, and so forth.

The book must have been begun towards the close of the
fourteenth century: the earliest document it contains is dated
1388, but as it appears on Fol. IV, and has been preceded by
several documents dated 1392, it was presumably inserted at
some period later than the date given. The handwriting, how-
ever, of the earliest documents seems to belong to the late
fourteenth or the early fifteenth century 3 and altogether it may
be guessed that the use of the book began somewhere between
1390 and 1400.

The documents contained in the Black Book are very various
in nature; the greater number consist of copies of conveyances
of land between burgesses and town dwellers, which have been
laid before the town court with a view to their acceptance by
the same, and to their consequent enrolment in the town
records. But the book also includes a few town ordinances, and
memoranda of important transactions in which the town was
concerned. These ordinances> and memoranda are for the most
part written in Old French, or, in the case of the later docu-
ments, in English. The conveyances, of course, are all in Latin„
