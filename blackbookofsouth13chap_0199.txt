On this day and to this court came, etc., Thomas Midlyngton,
burgess of the town of Southampton‚ and Margaret his wife, etc.,
and brought, etc., certain indented deeds, of which the substance
follows, etc. This indenture showeth that we, Thomas Mid-
lyngton, etc., and Margaret my wife, have given, etc., to John
Renawd, co-burgess of the same town, and Clemency his wife,
the whole of our tenement called 16 Bolehalle, situated in the
aforesaid town, in the parish of the church of St. Michael, in

 

now stands (E. R. Aubrey, Speed's Hist. ofSouthampton‚ p. 122, n.). After John Renaud it seems to
have passed into the hands of a certain John Sei-le (Terrier of 1455), and at the end of the fifteenth
century it was part of the property of Beaulieu (Ε. R. Aubrey, Speed’s H ist. of Southampt0n‚ p. 122).
Perkin Warbeck is said to have stayed there (ib). subsequently it belonged to the earls of Seuth-
ampton. It was in existence as ean-15 as the thirteenth century (Davies, Hist. of Soutkampton, 12455).
