customary by law. And we, the aforesaid Laurence and Agnes
my wife, and our heirs, will warrant the said ten shillings of
yearly quit rent, and also the aforesaid rent of twenty shilhngs,
when it shall asise, to the aforesaid william and William, their
heirs and assigns‚ against all men for ever. In witness of this
we have affixed our seals to this present charter, and for greater
security we have caused the seal of the mayor of the town of
Southampton to be placed here. These being witnesses, John
Pulmond‚ mayor, John Flete, bailiff, Richard Bradway, steward
of the town of Southampton‚ N icholas Langstoke, XValter Lang,

 

His position was well nigh as important as that of an alderman. The common chest was to be kept in
his house or that of the chief alderman (ἰὰ, Ord. 35). He kept the rolls and the treasure 11111161· the
alderman's seal (ἰὰ, Ord. 8), and, like the alderman, was permitted to introduce sti-angers to the Guild
(ih, Ord. 2). These rules refer to a period anterior to that of the Black Book, but the duties and
position of the steward seem to have continued the sanie during the fifteenth century. It is worthy of
note that in these deeris in the Black Book, burgesses appear first as holding the position of stewarr1s,
and subsequently attain to that of mayor or bailiff, suggesting that the steward's dignity 161Πῆ111611-
asin the period of the Oak Book Ordinances—slightly inferior to that of the other great Officers.

4 Nicholas Lanystoke, bailiff 1367, mayor 1374, 1379, and 1394 (Davies‚ Hist. of Southampton,
p. 172). He was a merchant and a man of property in the town. Like John Polymond‚ he appears to
have had an easy conscience in money matters. In 1378 he, with Richard May, John Flete. William
Bole, and others, was ραι-(1011611101 forestaliing (Pat. Rolbs Cal„ 1378, p. 81). Ι11 1380 116 was
accused (with what result does not appear) of having joined with certain other persons to forge recog-
nisances‚ under the Statutes ot Merchants, of a debt for 2550, payable by John and Richard
Wyncestre to a certain William Underhull, then dead. The object of this forgery was said to be to
invalidate the sale of the manor of Otterbourne by the said Richard Wyneestre ro Hugh Granni, of
Winchester. Langstoke was alleged to have been bribed to Join in the ferg-very by receiving recog-
nisances of certain debts ‹lue in Southampton (ia. 1380, p. 577). Whatever the upshoa Langstoke
could not have suffered severely, as ten years later he held a commis-sion to act as Collector of Petty
Customs (Pat. Rolls Cal⁸⁷ 1390, p. 357).

5 Walter Lanae, mayor 1393 and 1407, Parliamentary burgess 1397 and 1405-6 (J. S. Davies,
H ist. of Southampton, pp. 172-3 and 201-2). hike most of the prominent bui-gesses of Southampt0n‚
he was a merchant and shipowner. He may perhaps be identified with the Walter Longe who in 139⁸
was cominissioned to take mariners for his ship ‘¹ La Marie‚'' of Southampton‚ to carry the Duke of
Suri-ey to Ireland (Pac. Rolls Cal„ 1398, p. 438). In 1400 a grant of a ship called the “Mary
Knyght” was confirmed to 111111 (ἑὰ, 1400, p. 289). In 1402 he was one of a commission to super-vise
and prepare a number of ships for sea (ib, 1402, p. 196); and in 1403 116 was joined with the
mayor (Henry Holwey) and John Lymbourne in a commission to secure men at arms and archers
for the protection ot the wine ships salling to Bordeaux from the attacks of Breton rovers (ἰὰ, p. 298) ;
while, on the other hand, a few years later he was commissioned to arrest certain English pirates
(including the mayor of Poole!) who had lawlessly seized some Breton and Spanish ships (ib.‚ 1408,
p. 418).
