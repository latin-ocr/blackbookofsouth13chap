tion to order. Nor must it be imagined that these turbulent
burghers were without local patriotism. John Polymond built
the XVool House, which still exists. Thomas Midlyngton (mayor
in 1401, 1404, 616.) 61661611 61 quay and a crane for the con-
venience 01 landing goods at the West Gate. John Benet, as
is well known, left money in his will to bring fresh water 10 1116
town. Several 1611 money to 1116 Church‚ and funds for distribu—
tion among the poor. Thus the greater burgesses may have
achieved a degree of popularity which combined with the
disregard for law 10 increase their power; so that it is not
surprising 10 find distinct traces 01 oligarchic development in
Southampton towards the third quarter 01 1116 fifteenth century.

The most noteworthy development 01 11115 tendency appears
in the method 01 electing the mayor ; as has been seen, in 1413
the town Officers were elected by the mayor, aldermen, bailiffs
and community, but towards the middle 01 1116 fifteenth century
this right 01 1116 community seems to have been much restricted.
A custom apparently sprang up whereby the outgoing mayor
named two burgesseS, between whom the 61661015 had to make
their choice. Such an arrangement, of course, must have had
the effect of throwing the government 01 1116 town entirely into
the hands 01 0116 clique or party, and so presumably aroused
opposition. It may, possibly, have been as a result 01 91016515
against this arrangement that the two Lancastrian charters 01
1445 6111(1 1452 contained, 101 1116 first time, a provision for the
electiori of the town officers. The election was to be made
annually in the autumn by the assembly 01 burgesses. There is
no hint 01 any special intervention by the mayor; but despite
this, the interference seems to have flourished. The principal
opponent to the custom was, perhaps, John Payne, a merchant
conspicuous 101 1115 lawlessness even at that lawless time. His
name occurs frequently in the petitions to Chancery. Peter
James, with John Emmory and Richard Gryme, seem to have
had a special feud with John Payne and his relations; James
complained on one occasion that Payne had seized some wine,
and Emmory preferred a similar complaint against him;l
but these hostilities did not prevent his attaining office. He
was mayor in 1450, and his ally Andrew James in 1452. It
15 noteworthy that the latter year saw the confirmation 01
1116 charter 01 1445, with its clause concerning the election
