The Patent Rolls‚ for example, shew that piracy was exceed-
ingly common. Over and over again the great Genoese mer—
chants—the chief contributors to the prosperity of the town—
complain of the violent seizure of their ships and goods. ln
particular, the landing of commodities was a dangerous matter.
The huge Genoese carracks and galleys could not, apparently,
draw near to the wharves, and the goods were transferred to
little boats and so landed. This gave the Southarnpton men
their opportunity. On various occasions they swooped down
on these small defenceless boats and obtained the goods without
the trouble of paying for them.¹ The Genoese appealed to the
government for redress; then the governrnent issued a corn-
mission to the mayor, bailiffs and other burgesses of Southamp-
ton to inquire into the matter and do justice. Unluckily‚ this
laudable command must often have been disficult of execution ;
insomuch as it was occasionally issued to persons who had them-
selves at one time or another been guilty of similar offences,
or else of piracy on the open sea. Thus, William Soper was
accused of seizing the goods of some Castilian merchants in
1414, and a few years later was placed on a commission to
inquire into a similar attack on some Portuguese ; and in 1450
John Payn was charged with seizing a cargo of dye belonging
to a Rochelle ship, while in 1451 he was one of those appointed
to investigate into the spoiling of a Genoese vessel.2

Smuggling‚ too, was commom the complication of the cus-
toms, which included both specified and ad valorem duties, and
which varied for aliens and for burgesses, greatly facilitated
evasion. Accusations of illegal trade were brought in 1377
against John Flete, John Polymond‚ William Bole, Nicholas
Langstoke and others; the majority of whom, at one time or
another, filled the office of mayor or bailiff in Southampton.3
In 1397 smuggled woollen eloth and pepper to the amount of
[85 was seized by the governrnent.⁴ In 144o⁵ and 1444 com-
missions of inquiry were held as to the smuggling of goods by
Catalan, Venetian, Florentine and Genoese merchants, who
traded largely with Southampton ; and in 1448 John Somerton,
the collector of customs in the port, was accused of smuggling
