1 This is apparently the only copy extant of this early Andover charter. The date of its enrol-
ment in the Black Book was probably somevvhere near the middle of the fifteenth century, as the hand
in which it is inscribed appears to be somewhat later than that in which the preceding aud succeeding
pages are written. Possibly its entry may be due to the fact that Andover appears to have fallen into
a. state of poverty in the early flfteenth century, and its citizens, therefore, were anxious to maintain
all the liberties they possessed. There seems to have been some earlier dispute about the matter, as in
the Oak Book there is a fourteenth century list of boroughs claiming freedom of toll about which
inquiry is to be made, and this list includes Andover (Oak Book, Vol. Ι, pp. ix and 21). The date of
the charter itself was probably 1175. It was certainly granted before 1175-6‚ when the men of Andover
pald ten marks for their guild (V. Ο. H„ Hants, Vol. IV, p. 346) ; and Henry II appears to have been
at Winchester in November, 1175 (Royer de Hoveden, Rolis Series, ΙΙ, p. 85).

’2 Sic. ‘⁶ Per ‘¹ ls presumably omitted before “totam terram meam.”
3 The winchester charter was granted in 1112. It gave freedoni from toll, duty, tax, custom,
carriage, etc,

4 Sic. Probably a mistake for Sacr (le Quency‚ senior. the uncle of the Saer de Queiicy,ji1niox·,
the first Earl of Wiuchester. The nephew supported the young king, whereas the uncle adhered to
Hem-y Π. Hence the uncle is more likely to witness a chartei· granted by Henry Π (Die. Nat, Βίου.)
