lading, exclusive oswine, was worth about [110. On the out·
ward voyage the Southampton traders also shared in the car-
rack’s fortunes, as it sailed southward, laden with undyed cloths
and scarlet and tin. The same men often had small ventures
aboard the great Italian vesseIS, where the bulk of the cargo
belonged to Genoese or Florentine merchants. But a consider-
able part of the ventures of the Southampton traders was in
smaller ships commanded by English and Flemish masters, and
consisted of fish, salt, garlic, iron, friezes, haberdashery and
timberwork‚ which they imported in return for cloth.

Altogether, in the winter of 1433 the number of Southampton
merchants lading goods in the incoming and outgoing vessels
formed about one-third of the whole number of traders. Of the
inland trade, of course, they took a far larges share; but even
here they had to endure the rivalry of the Genoese. The latter
received a special grant in 1402,¹ whereby they were permitted
to take their goods, especially woad, overland from Southamp-
ton to London, paying all custom dues at Southampton. This
roused the indignation of the Londoners, who saw themselves
deprived thereby of a part of their tolls; and they were only
conciliated in 1444, when the sum lost by the grant to the
Genoese was deducted from the London ferm.2

The importance of the inland trade is witnessed by the long
series of Brokage Books, now to be seen in the Southampton
Audit House. The account for 1440 shews iron, fish, fruit,
sugar, inadder, alum, dye, spices, all taken through the North
Gate. In the first week in September, 1440, a hundred and
twenty-eight bales of woad were carried to various towns,
including London and Coventry, besides wine, madder, spices
and oil; and the carriers brought back cloths, kerseys, hides,
salt and wool.

Other tokens of the importance of Southampton’s inland trade
appear in the constant references in the Calendmfs of the Patent
Rolls to the connection of the Southampton traders with the
traders of other towns. In 1438 cloth, lambskins, calfskins and
pewter vessels were packed in London and sent overland to
Sandwich and Southampton for export.³ The actions for debt
shew the Southampton merchants as supplying half the little
