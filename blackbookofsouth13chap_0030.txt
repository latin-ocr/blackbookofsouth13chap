XX. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

but only with the advice of his “most discrete bretherne.'’ Such
an enactment clearly suggests an effort on the part of the town
to take a greater share in managing its own concerns ; and it is
in accordance with the whole tenor of the ordinances that it
should be signed by the “aldermen, shryve and discretes, the
12 juratts with dyvers other burgayses‚” and ordained by the
mayor with the assent of the “four Aldermen, the Shryff,
comnalty,” a formula as full, and presumably implying as great
a degree of popular agreement as that occurring on the first
page of the Black Book a hundred years earlier.

Hence a survey of the ordinances in the Black Book, as
compared with the charters and general events of the tirne, does
certainly suggest the idea of an increasing tendency towards
oligarchy in Southampton culminating in the reign of Edward IV,
and followed by a constitutional revival under Henry Vll.

From this the question naturally arises, what causes con-
tributed to these tendencies-if they existed; and, especially,
what brought about the constitutional revival ?

TRADE IN SOUTHAMPTON.

As regards the earlier tendency,—that towards oligarchy,—
one cause has already been mentioned ; to wit, the lawlessness
of the period. Another may be found in the development of
commerce during the fifteenth century. A consideration of
Southampton‘s trade at this time suggests two observations. It
was becoming more and more a trade in luxuries, and capital
was beginning to be concentrated in a few hands.

From its position Southampton was naturally and pre-
eminently a trading town. Industrialism did, indeed, play
some part in its economic life; but it was a subordinate
part. Southampton's great wealth came from its trade, and
this trade was many-sided. There was a certain amount of
coasting trade : the little ships from the south and west country
ports, such as Fowey and Dartmouth and Poole, came with fish
or salt, corn or tin ; from Ireland came salmon and Irish friezes
and ‘1nantels’; ships came from Brittany and Aquitaine with
wine and woad, fruit and oil 3 but, above all, the great Spanish
and ltalian carracks resorted to Southampton, where by special
ordinance they were permitted to lade tin, wool and eloth,
instead of being compelled to run the risks of the Channel by
