To this court came Thomas Midlyngton and Joan his wife,
in their own persons, and brought, eto, a certain deed of
feoffment, whereof the substance follows etc. Know all
men that I, Thomas Midlyngton, burgess of the town of
Southampton, and Joan my wife, eto, have sold, etc„ to John
Estwell, burgess os the aforesaid town, our two stalls situated
in the town aforesaid, in the parish of the church of Holy Rood,
in English Street, on the west side of the same street, between
the tenement of John Manton, formerly belonging to Henry
Manton, on the north and the tenement of Thomas Coke and
Alice his wife, and formerly belonging to Richard Coppe,
on the south; and these two stalls were formerly four stans,
and the same two stalls with their appurtenances we, the
aforesaid Thomas and Joan my wife, have lately bought
from Richard Godefray‚ son and heir of Roger Godefray and
Petronilla his wife, daughter and heiress of John Bolt, late
burgess of the town of Southampton, to have and to hold the
aforesaid two stalls, eto, to the aforesaid John Estwell‚ his heirs
and assigns for ever from the chief lords of those fees, by the
services thence due, etc. In witness whereof we, the aforesaid
Thomas Midlyngton and Joan my wife, have affixed our seals
to these presents. And for greater safety we have caused the
seal of the mayoralty of Southampton to be affixed thereto.
These being witnesses, John Beneyt, mayor of the aforesaid
town, William Overay, Henry Holewey and Richard Bradewey,
aldermen, John Maschall and Thomas Armorer, bailiffs of the

 

numerous hewere, carpentem, and labourers were pald 4d. a day [or varying perieris, and two plumbers
from Romeey received 60l- (Foreign Acconnts, 1³· 9 Henry V F).

5 ‘⁸ Stagia.'’ This word, according to Du cange, should be translated “dwelling place.'’ In Davies'
History os southampton (p. 437) it is, however, translated “stalle'’ Possibly its real meaning in
this instance was that of a vacant place or holding where booths were habitually erected; the fact
that the two “stagia'' were formerly four suggests the possibility of their being in some way
tempor-ary erectione.

6 Roqer Godfray was jurat in the reign ot Edward III (Oak Book, Vol. 11, p. 130). Richard
Godrray was a mercer, apparently with a considerable trade. as in 1392-ss he received 5:40 from a
London mercer, to whom he subsequently released a tenement in English Street (Hist. MSS. Com.
Report, XI, Appendix III, p. 73).
