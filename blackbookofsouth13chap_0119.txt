OF SOUTHAMPTON. 73

 

Southampton. Court held there before Thomas Midlyngton‚
then mayor there, Henry Holewey and John Barflet, then
bailiffs, on the Tuesday next before the Feast of St. Valentine

the martyr, 4 Henry IV.

To this court came, in their own persons, John Harre and
Cristina his wife, and laid before the aforesaid mayor and bailiffs
a certain deed of feoffment, of which the' substance follows in
these words. Know all men, present and to come, that we,
John Harre and Cristina my wife, by unanimous agreement and
consent have given, granted and, by this our present deed, con-
firmed to John Seldere, burgess of the town of Southampton, a
certain garden of ours lying in the town aforesaid, in the parish
of the church of All Saints, in the street called Estret‚ on the
north of the same street, between the tenement of John Barfiet
on the west and the garden of Joan who was the wife of John
Makesburgh on the east, and the said garden stretches from the
king's highway on the south to a certain path by the walls of
the said town on the north. To have and to hold the aforesaid
garden with all its appurtenances to the aforesaid John Seldere,
his heirs and assigns‚ from the chief lord of that fee, for services
thence due and accustomed by law for ever. And we, indeed,
the aforesaid John Harre and Cristina my wife, and our heirs,
will warrant the aforesaid garden with all its appurtenances to
the aforesaid john Seldere‚ his heirs and assigns, against all men
and defend it for ever. In testimony whereof we affiX our seal to ,
this present deed. And because our seals are unknown to many
persons, we have procured the seal of the office of mayor of
the aforesaid town to be affixed to these presents. Wstnesses,
Thomas Midlyngton, then mayor of the said town, John
Flete, Walter Lange, John Botiller and William Ravenston,
then aldermen there, Henry Holewey and John Barfl'et, then
bailiffs, Thomas Armorer, steward, John Notebern, William

 

pp. 134-5). He paid 12d. a year to the town for this gamen, which may perhaps be identified wltli the
gar ’(-11 called ¹⁶ Pylgrym ys pyt,'' which ‘the Steward·s Book os 1441 shows 111111 as holding of the town
by the same rent. He also held three tenements of St. Denys, outside the East Gate beside the town
111031, sor which he paid 48d. ayear (Rent. and Survey‚ 25 Henry VI, Roll 596).

⁵ This reason for requiriug the addition or the town's seal to the deed frequently replaces the
more usual phrase, ‘⁸ ad maiorem huius rei securitatem.” Mrs. Green (Town Life in the Fifteenth-
Conturv) suggests that its use was a consequence of the increasing number of etr-angers who were
attracted to the towns in the fifteenth century: but as far as Soutbampton deeds are concerned lt
was frequently used 111 the case of persons who had been long resident in the town and had held high
municip-al office ; hence it may probably be regarded as a mere formula.
