HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. XXi.

resorting to the staple at Calais.1 In return they brought to
Southampton wine and oil and waX‚ together with alum for
cloths, dyes——such as cochineal, madder and woad. Iron came,
too, from Spain; and Spanish and Italian ships alike brought
unwoven silk, and sugar and spices from the east.

From the Hanse towns and the Eastland came more homely
and more necessary goods: timber and pitch and cordage for
the shipping; and articles of domestic use, earthenware‚ haber-
dashery and woodwork‚ like wainscots and cupboards, and
counters, and innumerable other small articles of domestic use?
The returns were made chiefly in cloth, wool, hides and corn,
brought to Southampton partly in coasting vessels and partly
overland. The imports were, of course, largely re-distributed
throughout England. A considerable proportion went by land.
Day by day the heavily loaded wains, interspersed with strings
of packhorses, passed through the Bargate for Salisbury‚ W in-
chester‚ Romsey, and other towns in the south of England. A
large part of these goods went also to London; and even still
farther afield‚-—to Gloucester or Coventry or Northampton.

The share of the ships and merchants of Southampton in all
this trade seems, at first, singularly small. In the early years of
the fifteenth century the little English traders could no more
bear comparison with‚the great mercantile houses of the south
than the little English coasting vessels could equal the towering
galleys of Genoa or of Florence.

Still the Southampton merchants claimed their part, if it was a
small one. Such vessels as the “Ghost'’ or the “Valentine,” or the
“ Anthony ’' or the “ Gyllyan '⁷ of Southampton, would sail south-
ward, laden with cloth, corn or hides, the property of half-a—dozen
Southampton burgesses‚ and return with wine and dyes, oil and
iron ; or, again, ships were sent, presumably to the other English
ports, laden with the wine and oil already brought from Italy.
Even in the Italian and Spanish ships themselves the South-
ampton merchants took their share. In 1433 the lading of a
great carrack, containing wine, wax, figs and oil, belonged
almost entirely to a company of Southampton burgesses—

John Emery, Robert Aylward‚ Robert Florys and others.3 The
