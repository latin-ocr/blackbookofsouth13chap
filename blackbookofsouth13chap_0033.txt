towns in Somerset and Dorset, besides those farther afield, such
as Oxford and Eristol and Coventry. With the latter town
in 1456 Southampton entered into an agreement for mutual
exemption from toll¹; many years earlier the goods of the men
of Salisbury had been admitted to Southampton at only half
the usual rate. On the whole, it seems possible that the traders
of Southampton may have been even more concerned with its
inland traffic than with its sea-going trade. It was not only a
port, it was a centre for the distribution of goods throughout
the whole of southern England.

As the century progressed the trade of Southampton‚ both
seaborne and inland, became to some extent modified. The goods
imported increase both in variety and luxury. The Brokage
Books of 1440 shew many additions to the early list of goods
on which toll was levied, recorded in the Oak Book. White
soap--an important article both of import and of inland trade ;
malvoisy—not hitherto differentiated from other wines ; fustians,
kersey, Cologne thread, Genoese “ confections‚'’ were all articles
of trade in the early fifteenth century of which no mention was
made a hundred years earlier. As time went on the variety
and luxury of the imports continued to increase. Little articles
of household comfort—such as feather beds and cushions, brushes
and mirrors-—appeared in the Customs accounts& small articles
of dress like points and spurs; rare and rich textiles like velvet
and cloth of gold. By about 1472 the quantity and variety of
the luxuries have increased again3 coral and amber and satin
and brocade were added to the imports. On the other hand
there seems to be a lessening of the trade in materials for the
cloth industry‚ such as woad and alum, which in the earlier
years of the fifteenth century had ranked next to wine in the
list of imports. On the whole, as far as the import trade was
concerned, manufactured articles for personal use were gaining
on materials needed to assist in the industry of the country. In
other words the trade was to a greater degree than formerly
a trade to supply the demands of the wealthy.

This development in the nature of the trade was accompanied
by certain fluctuations in its quantity; up to the era of the VVars
of the Roses trade seems to have increased. Neither the war
with France‚ smuggling‚ nor‘piracy sufficed to seriously check
