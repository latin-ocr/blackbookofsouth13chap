XXiV. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

it. In the fifteen years between 1433 and 1448 there seems to
have been a considerable increase in the export of cloth and

import of wine, coupled with a slight falling off in the export .

of wool. The export of tin also increased in a marked degree1;
and while the diversity and luxury of the articles were on the
increase, there was as yet no falling off in the dyes, which next
to wine were the staple import. The Brokage Books tell
the same tale. Comparing the first week in November, January‚
April, June and September in the years 1440 and 1460, the later
date shews a marked increase over the earlier in the amount
of woad, tin and alum sent from Southampton by land.
Apparently the five years of civil war had not yet seriously
checked the town’s trade. The Customs Accounts and Brokage
Books of the reign of Edward IV shew, however, a marked
change. As has been said, the Brokage Books were ill kept;
but making allowance for what may have been contained in
the carts of “divers merchandise,” the departure of which is
commemorated, it still seems clear that trade during the five
selected weeks of 1482 shews a decrease during the twenty
years that had elapsed since 14603 certainly both less woad
and less wine travelled inland. It is possible that the disturbed
state of the country had contributed to this result. At any rate,
about this time the carriers seem to have started in companies
of a dozen or more, instead of dribbling through the Bargate
in ones and twos, as the entries in the earlier Brokage Books
suggest.

There is, however, no such notable diminution in the sea-
borne trade. In the winter of 1471-2 the import of wine and
luxuries had increased; that of dye and of alum had lessened.
The export of cloth shewed a fall from the export of 1448, but
an increase on the quantity sent out in the beginning of the
reign of Henry VI. The export of tin had greatly lessened.
On the whole the import trade seems to have increased and
the export to have lessened; but the most noteworthy point is
the change in the number of ships and of traders. In the
winter of 1433 about thirty—eight vessels seem to have been
unladen at Southampton, and about thirty-one to have left
the port with their cargoes. Fifteen years later there was a
slight increase in their numbers. In the winter of 1471-2 there
were only about thirty-five entries and twenty-three issues. But
