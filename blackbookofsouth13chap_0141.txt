1 Tuesday‚ September 27th, 1407.

2 The appearance of a woman alone laying before the court a deed made jointly by herself and
her husband is noteworthy. It is possible that she was acting as proxy or attorney for her husband,
though no statement to that effect appears in the manuscript. In the thirteenth century women were
competent to act as attorneys for their husbauds (Pollock aud Maltlaud, Hist. of Enylish Law,

V01.11‚p.408).

3 Mosehole, or MounehOEe, as it is called elsewhere, occurs several times in the Black Book, but
mentions ot it in other recorda seem rare. It does not occur in the Terrier of 1455.

4 This deod is not said to be sealed with the seal of the mayoralty.
