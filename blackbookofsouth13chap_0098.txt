1 Wilziam Nz‘eholl and Elene his wife. This William is presumably the father of the William
Nyeoll who founded a chantry after 1452 (Davies⁷ Hist. of Southampton‚ p. 423). The present William
Nicholl (or Nyeoll, or Nicol) must have died before 1443, as a curious demand was made in that year
on his executore by one John Wythyell, of Bodmin. Wythyell came some years previously to his
‘⁵ rich cousin‚” William Nyeoll, burgess and goldsmith of Soutlmmpton, and offered to serve him. The
offer was accepted, and the Cornishman remained a mouth with Nyeoll, during which time he offered
to marry Nyeoll’s step-daughter, Katharine, “ albeit, he the said John, had a wife living at Bodman.''
Thereon Nycoil‚ naturally enough, ordered the said John to be gone to his own wife and house.
And Wythyell, apparently out of revenge, sued Nyeoll’s executors‚ on the latter-’s death, for 5:100,
which he declared was owing to hini on bond (Hist. MSS. Com. Report. XI, Appendix III, p.111).
Nyeoll was a man of considerable wealth; Henry V seems to have left numerous jewels with him in
pledge in order to raise money for the French war. These jewels seem not to have been redeemed, for
Henry VI granted Nyeoll a general pardon for all crimes up to date, except coming and clipping and
one or two other felonies; also all Nyeoll's debts, fines, taxes and so forth were remitted, and he was
no longer bound to return the jewels (Letters Patent, 15 Hem-y VI. These letters do not appear in
the Calendar of the Patent Bolis ; they are among the Southampton MSS„ and were kindly shown
to me by Mr. Η. W. Gidden). Nieholl was a trader as well as goldsmitln his name appears 111 the
customs accounts as importing wine and iron (K. R. Customs ale, 5-6 Henry IV, 139l7) ; and a few years
later he joined with William Soper in chartering a Breton vessel (Hist. MSS. Com. Repert, XI,
Appendix ΙΙΙ, p. 78). He was bailiff in 1401 and 1407 and mayor in 1411, 1417, 1422‚and 1427, and
possibly in 1437, unless the Nieholl then mentioned is his son (Davis‚ Hist. ofSouthampton, p. 173).
