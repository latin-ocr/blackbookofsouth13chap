4 That the widow should act as her husband’s executrix was a matter or common occurrence, but
in the present instance the widow acts as executi-ix with the concurrence „f her new-made husband.
The need for his intervention in the matter may perhaps arise from the fact that, as the executor was
regarded as the representative of the deceased, the wife, when acting as executriX, may be considered
as baving some kind of possessory interest in the lande which she administered, and her new husband'fl
concurrence in their alienation was therefore thought necessary z or it may simply have been an
additional sareguard. Possibly Alie-ia was legates as well as executrix‚ but this is not stated in the text.

⁵ Thomas Belle, alias Reoald (see Fol. xx), bailiff (under the name of Regald) 1413,1415,and
1418, mayor (under the name of Belle) 1423, 1430, and 1431 (Davies, Hist. os Southampton, p. 173).
His name appears with that, of other merchants as part owner in the lading of the ‘⁸ Ghost,'’ of South-
ampton, which traded chiefly in wine (Port Book, 1428).
