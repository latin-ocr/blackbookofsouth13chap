OF sournAMPTON. 69

 

Court held there before Thomas Middelyngton, then mayor
there, Henry Holewey and William Nicholl, then bailiffs, on
the Tuesday of the day which is called St. Peter ad vincula, in
the third year of the reign of King Henry IV.

On this day came Richard Bradewey, burgess of the town of
Southampton‚ executor of the will of Juliana who was the wife
of Walter Reigate, burgess of Southampton aforesaid, and laid
before the aforesaid mayor and bailiffs a certain deed, of which
the substance follows in these words. Know all men, present
and future, that I, Richard Bradewey, burgess of the town of
Southampton, executor of the will of Juliana who was wife of
XValter Reygate, burgess of Southampton aforesaid, by virtue
and authority of the same will have sold, granted, and by this
present deed have confirmed for a certain sum of money to John
Deryng and John Mascall, burgesses of the town aforesaid, the
reversion of two tenements with a vault built underneath, in
the town of Southampton aforesaid, situated side by side in
English Street, on the west side of the street, between the
tenement lately belonging to Richard Mountagu, knight, which
Master Thomas Mountagu, Dean of the Cathedral Church of
Salisbury, now holds on the north side and the tenement which
belonged to William Oldefrend, in which William Blak now
lives, on the south side, and the king’s highway on the east,
and the curtilage lately belonging to the said Richard and now
to the aforesaid Master Thomas on the west side, and these tene-
ments the aforesaid Juliana, in her testament in her last will,
bequeathed to the aforesaid Walter Reigate for the term of his
life, and after the death of the same Walter, to William Wellys‚

in English Sti-eet was executed in favour ot Mai-gery, wife to John Mascall, late burgess of South-
ampton (ib, p. 377). Mascall, like other Southampton burgesses, was an active trader. The Customs
Accounts show him as snat-ing in the lading of numerous vessels and as importing both wine and
saffron (ομ, Κ. R. Customs alc, 13917, eto).

Δ Richard Montayu, knight, was probably one of the sous ot Sir John Montagu, who was brother
ot tho second aud father of the third Earl of Sallsbury ; Richard montagu himself thus being brother
of the third eari. Burke, indeed, does not mention any Richard among the sons of Sir John Montagu ;
but as Dugdale gli-es a certain Rich-ard Montagu as one of the younger sons of Sir John (Dugdale.
Baronaqe, Vol. Ι, pp. 649-50), aud as the Patent Roas Calendar for 1397 givesacertain Richard
Montagu, son of Sir John Montagu, as holding lands in southampton (Pat. Rolls Cal, 1397, p. 274),
the probabilities are that the mistake lles with BurRe, and that Richard Montagu may be identified
with Robert Montagu of sutton Montagu, in Somerset (Burke’s Domestic Peeraye, p. 372), mentioned

by Burke as a son of the above Sir John Montagu.

5 Thomas Montaqu. brother ot the above llichard Moutagu, died 1404.
