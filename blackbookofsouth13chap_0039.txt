institutions for which the extreme lawlessness of the time gives
little warrant. But as far as the internal life of Southampton
itself went,—as far as concerned the relations of the burgesses
to each other‚—lawlessness may have been rather the exception
than the rule. The Southampton men would bully aliens, rob
the vessels of other countries, cheat the king's officers, and evade
his laws as they thought fit. But to their own laws, made in
their own town, it is possible they paid more heed ; as well they
might, seeing that the laws in question were framed with their
own consent and in their own interest.

The very existence of the Black Book itself witnesses to the
respect for local law. These records of private transactions
were made that the transactions might be publicly owned as
valid, and that there should be irrefragable evidence on the
subject in case of dispute. Hence the miscellaneous character
of the records. For instance, two charters of the neighbouring
town of Andover were enrolled in the Black Book—presumably
that Andover might have its rights in the matter of tolls.
The Black Book is a volume of evidence, and of evidence
which has been recorded in order to facilitate the administra-

INDUSTRIAL REGULATIONS.

More direct proof of the value set upon local law is to be
found in the industrial ordinances, of which one or two are
enrolled in the Black Book.

Industry in Southampton undoubtedly occupied a position
inferior to trades—still it did exist; and when any craft had
raised itself to a position of iniportance it looked to the local
law for protection against rivalry. Three crafts at least in
Southampton—the tailors, the coopers and the cordwainers—
thus appealed for the town’s assistance during the fifteenth
century.

The tailors must have been a well-established guild by 1406.
In this year they laid before the mayor and burgesses an
indignant complaint against the foreign tailors. The English
tailors complained that they, as inhabitants of the town,
contributed “according to their simple power⁹⁹ to the town
defences; and formerly they drew considerable profit from
aliens coming to the port in ships of Spain, Portugal, Germany,
F landerS, Zealand and prussia, which brought cloths‚ which
